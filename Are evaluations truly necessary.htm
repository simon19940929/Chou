	<font size="4" face="Batang">The Higher Education Evaluation and 
	Accreditation Council of Taiwan recently released the results of an 
	evaluation of nine public universities conducted in the first half of last 
	year. Although more than 89 percent did not pass the evaluation, 42 
	faculties and graduate institutes were placed on a list for future 
	monitoring. </font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4" face="Batang">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Surprisingly, many of these were from universities with good reputations 
	such as National Chengchi University and National Tsing Hua University. The 
	Ministry of Education (MOE) has said that faculties and graduate institutes 
	that did not pass the evaluation failed mostly because they suffered from a 
	severe shortage of full-time teachers or failed to clearly define their 
	teaching goals, adding that they would be closed if they failed to pass the 
	next round of evaluations to be conducted next year.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taiwan¡¦s university evaluations had always been performed by 
	external organizations. It was only in July 2006 that the council started 
	conducting such evaluations, which were primarily aimed at faculties and 
	graduate institutes.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the most recent evaluations, faculties and graduate institutes 
	first carried out self-evaluations and then mapped out development goals on 
	their own. The evaluation center then visited and conducted interviews based 
	on these development goals.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The evaluations were based on five criteria: goals, specialties and 
	self-improvement; curriculum; teaching; student performance; teacher 
	research and graduate student performance. University evaluations can be 
	positive if they can help faculties, graduate institutes, teachers and 
	students redefine their goals for study and teaching.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the past two years, these evaluations have also given 
	many schools a great deal of pressure.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This pressure includes having tens of thousands of university staff 
	working around the clock to complete these evaluations, printing information 
	onto tens of thousands of tonnes of paper, compiling statistical data and 
	creating computer records, as well as demanding that faculty answer 
	questions that are not suited to data-based research and requiring that 
	teachers answer questions on classified research and other personal 
	questions.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially worthy of attention are those schools that may lose 
	their social prestige because they fared poorly in their evaluations. These 
	schools may even have their government subsidies decreased or canceled, and 
	their admission quotas frozen.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what we really must ask ourselves is whether the evaluated 
	universities can really improve after all that energy, manpower and money 
	was put into these assessments.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who benefits from this evaluation mechanism?<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as one evaluation leader who had just finished a university 
	evaluation said: ¡§When universities work day and night preparing information 
	for never-ending evaluations and when teachers focus a great deal of energy 
	on getting good results in National Science Council projects to help them 
	obtain better evaluation results for their faculties, submitting articles to 
	Social Science Citation Index journals, spending money to invite businesses 
	to engage in industry-academic cooperation and even going overseas, 
	including to China, to obtain doctoral degrees, teachers do not have a lot 
	of time left to devote to their students.¡¨<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They also do not have a lot of energy or concentration to devote to 
	critical thinking and research. Indeed, there are now very few faculty 
	directors and university presidents who can stop their schools from becoming 
	more stratified and market-oriented, with an increasing emphasis on 
	quantitative research.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While the sharp increase in the number of university evaluations in 
	recent years is closely linked to increasingly lower numbers of students 
	being accepted into courses and a lack of places in courses, Taiwan¡¦s 
	academic circle is very small, with more emphasis placed on interpersonal 
	relationships over academic achievement.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why there has been a move toward quantitative evaluations. 
	In order to gain more prestige for Taiwan¡¦s universities on an international 
	scale, many faculties in various universities have recently been focusing on 
	working according to quantitative standards like those used in the Social 
	Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the 
	Engineering Index (EI) to make distinctions between their teachers in terms 
	of seniority and skill.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the previous emphasis on self-determination of 
	academic goals and a respect for the decisions of academics will cease to 
	exist very soon. No wonder foreign academics have said that young academics 
	here in Taiwan lock themselves up in research rooms and laboratories to 
	write papers for SSCI and SCI journals and therefore have no time or 
	interest in anything that goes on in society.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do universities really need evaluations? Almost everybody would 
	agree that some sort of university evaluation is necessary. However, 
	Taiwan¡¦s academic circle often ignores the differences between specialized 
	academic fields, using physics and engineering standards to assess the 
	humanities and social sciences, which has led to an over-emphasis on 
	quantitative assessment.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even government agencies and the evaluation center ignore the 
	serious negative consequences of these quantitative evaluations ¡X Taiwan¡¦s 
	entire academic field has become a center for academic contract 
	manufacturing and reproduction. Universities are becoming more and more 
	utilitarian and academic ideals and the passion teachers have for teaching 
	are rapidly decreasing.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we really hope that this current system of university 
	evaluation will improve universities? In addition to their research, can we 
	encourage teachers to place more emphasis on student progress? Perhaps we 
	could get those faculties and graduate institutes that have already been 
	assessed to provide us with their thoughts and even conduct a meta-analysis 
	of the current evaluation system. This could turn the evaluations into a 
	catalyst for a more open mindset and help universities find their ideals 
	once again.<br>
