<span style="font-size: 14pt">In New Zealand, most schools open from 9:00 a.m. 
to 3:00 p.m. Students do not have too much homework after school so that they 
have time to engage in social activities and sports. Subject learning in the 
classroom is not the only part of school life. Moreover, children are taught how 
to live, how to plan their career, and how to take responsibilities for 
themselves in New Zealand while most Taiwanese students spend their long hours 
at school, to cram schools, on video games, and watching TV. New Zealand schools 
value all-rounded education rather than academic drilling. People might be 
wondering: What type of kids would Kiwi schools produce to prepare them for 
later competitive adult life? In fact, New Zealand primary and secondary 
students rank among the highest groups in world competitions. According to the 
OECD (2003) statistics, Kiwi students¡¦ performance in math, reading, science and 
problem solving rank from 4<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup>. The UNESCO also 
highly recommended New Zealand¡¦s remarkable education system. In spite of 
academic achievement, Kiwi¡¦s sports also outperform their counterparts in many 
ways. For example, New Zealand received 3 silver and 2 gold medals in 2004 
Olympic Games in Athens despite her small population of less then 4 million. We 
can not wonder but ask why going to school can be as enjoyable and rewarding as 
in New Zealand? In answering these questions, Professor Chou from National 
Cheng-Chi University, Taiwan, provided her observations as follows.</span></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 14pt" lang="EN-US">From her books entitled ¡§The Great 
Experiment of Taiwanese Education (1987-2003)¡¨ to ¡§Love from New Zealand: 
Education for Excellence and Creativity¡¨, Chou expressed her great concerns 
about Taiwanese current educational reform. After a comprehensive examination of 
Taiwanese reform policies and practices in education, Chou turned her research 
interest to New Zealand by unfolding her educational reform in the last 20 years 
with the hope for alternative experiences. Through many in-depth school visits 
and interviews, Chou composed 61 essays about the myths and realities of New 
Zealand schools. In so doing, Chou hoped to provide Taiwanese policy makers and 
the public with an alternative view from New Zealand.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 14pt" lang="EN-US">In ¡§Love from New Zealand¡¨, the 
author tries to layout many scenarios from New Zealand education practices in 
which parents, teachers, schools and government collaborate with one another so 
that they can efficiently and effectively invest more time and resources into 
education. Every three years, each school is assessed by the NZ Education Review 
Office (ERO). Students¡¦ achievement is not limited to obedience to teachers, 
having good test scores or achieving grades. What is more important is to see 
whether students make progress in a wide range of curriculum areas? Whether they 
can take initiatives, care about others and be self-responsible is a top 
priority. The Six-Thinking-Hats theory is widely adopted among primary and 
secondary teachers. The rationale behind this practice is to facilitate 
student¡¦s high-order-thinking skills. It is also a priority to improve literacy 
and numeracy among students by checking whether students are interested in 
raising questions and solving problems in learning.</span></p>

Playgrounds, community parks, and the natural environment serve as learning 
sites for all children. New Zealand ranks 15<sup>th</sup> among the most 
comfortable countries to live in. Not only a country full of beautiful 
landscapes, safe environment, and friendly people but also good infra-structure 
including excellent school campuses which impress visitors. It is the natural 
resources and environment that provide New Zealand students and teachers with 
broader visions and attitudes. Children love going to school where they can 
enjoy learning, playing with their peers, living without pressure, and exploring 
nature along with acquiring attitude, knowledge, and skills in the classroom. 
The sizes are not overwhelmingly large in most schools. The biggest primary 
school comprises less than 800 students in comparison with 3000 in another large 
secondary school. Most schools are equipped with a big field where children can 
run, play football, and engage in all kinds of outdoors activities. Playing, for 
Kiwi kids, is very important because it is a great opportunity for children to 
experience human development, peer interaction and problem solving. Regarding 
sports, most Kiwi parents insist that their children play sport activities for 
fun and enjoyment, instead of competing with others.</span></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 14pt" lang="EN-US">As a result of the current decile 
system from the Ministry of Education, many local schools depend on fund-raising 
from local communities to supplement their school budget. Fund-raising can also 
provide a golden opportunity for children and teachers to have teamwork and 
morale building. Children¡¦s artwork, pottery craft and even orchestral 
performance can serve as programs to attract parents and communities to 
participate in school affairs. In addition, through these fund-raising 
activities, children not only increase their sense of belonging, but also 
acquire creativity and talents. </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="font-size: 14pt" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Learning does not only take place in the classroom. Learning also occurs in many 
extra-curriculum activities, such as museum visits and train trips. These 
out-door activities can be regarded as great sources of lively learning 
experiences for children in which they are free to explore, experience and 
participate. School learning themes are interwoven with a wide variety of 
programs and activities. Usually an outdoor school visit is based on a school 
theme which integrates geography, astronomy, humanity and other subjects from 
school.</span></p>

Why do New Zealand children enjoy going to school? The answer is probably that 
not only is a school filled with lots of fun stuff but also with lots of 
interesting teachers. New Zealand teachers are very well prepared through 
teacher preparation programs and continuing in-service training. As a matter of 
fact, it is the philosophy and practice of ¡§learning by doing¡¨ and ¡§ learning by 
teaching¡¨ that helps teachers explore themselves in the long run, by engaging in 
sports, painting, artwork, drama and lots of fun activities. Although Taiwanese 
primary and secondary teachers receive solid salary and enjoy high social 
status, their attitudes are not as vibrant and positive as their New Zealand 
counterparts. The latter enjoy lively interaction with students in the classroom 
and undertake outdoor activities with professional confidence. School evaluation 
every three years and compulsory in-serve training enforces teacher¡¦s motivation 
for professional growth. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 27.0pt; line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 14pt" lang="EN-US">Streaming and grouping are not 
uncommon in New Zealand schools where teachers are trying to meet different 
needs of children. The so-called ¡§spinal curriculum design¡¨ also allows children 
to fully acquire knowledge and skills within certain school years even for those 
with learning difficulties. Lively teaching methods, respect for individuality, 
and encouragement for creativity are all school features in New Zealand. It is 
also the case in New Zealand where textbooks are not mandatory or the only 
source of learning. Most teachers will work together and make the best use of 
their rich resources and facilities at school to design their own curriculum, 
conduct instruction, and share ideas. For example, in an English class, a 
secondary teacher was trying to convey the theme entitled ¡§how to express 
yourself with different ways¡¨. In so doing, the teacher used the movie ¡§Batman¡¨ 
to introduce multi-levels of language expression. The teacher grouped students 
into different pairs to allow more in-class discussion and seatwork. No specific 
textbook but many handouts were distributed in the whole session. In addition, 
subjects and teaching methods are also drawn from different walks of life which 
makes classroom teaching more real. Literacy and numeracy receive the priority 
in most primary schools, where communities and school libraries are accessible 
and supportive for children¡¦s reading. New Zealand children are also outstanding 
in math and logic reasoning. Most primary and secondary teachers are encouraged 
to spend more time on numeracy and logic reasoning especially by introducing 
¡§5W&amp;1H ¡§(who, when, where, what, why, how) to facilitate teacher-student 
interaction. Most teachers will adopt different kinds of tools such as dice and 
toys to establish an environment for math computation and reasoning. 
High-order-thinking skills such as the ¡§Six Thinking Hats¡¨ are also very common 
in most of the classrooms.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 18.0pt; line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 14pt" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast with 
Taiwanese kids who suffer from high pressure from schools, New Zealand students 
have more freedom in their homework and assignments. Many New Zealand principals 
make sure that homework for primary kids will not exceed 30 minutes per day to 
allow children to have more time in social interaction with others. Most 
homework is arranged not for drill and practice, but for theme exploration, 
question development and information analysis. Not only at universities, but 
also in secondary and primary schools, teachers are dedicated to facilitating 
students¡¦ thinking and synthesis abilities. Even the school performance sheets 
after each term will include test scores and learning attitude. In this respect, 
New Zealand follows the Chinese great master, Confucius¡¦s great philosophy: ¡§to 
teach with respect for individual differences and to instruct without 
discrimination¡¨.</span></p>

It is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of the New Zealand school 
system and life style if parents want to send their children to this country. 
Deeply influenced by the British tradition, New Zealand children start going to 
school at the age of 5, then move up all the way to 6<sup>th</sup> grade at 
primary level, two years at intermediate and 5 years of high school or college. 
Every public secondary school enjoys very much the same resources, in terms of 
facilities, teacher qualifications, and curriculum. The introduction of National 
Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) in 2002 was to replace the earlier 
Bursary exam. NCEA is now the main tertiary education entrance exam which is 
divided into 4 levels and each secondary student can start sitting that exam 
from form 5 onward in secondary schools. The NCEA serves as an indicator for 
university major options as well as a job certificate and high school diploma. 
Parents can learn more information from the ERO website which will regularly 
provide schools with evaluation reports, including school location, the profile 
of the campus, teacher and student ratio, government funding, and school 
accountability.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Parental companionship is crucial and very much encouraged for international 
students to New Zealand. Recently, New Zealand schools have been very active in 
recruiting overseas students not only for financial reasons but also to meet the 
needs of diversity in a knowledge-based society. Many schools will also arrange 
free special programs for parents who accompany their children in New Zealand.</span><p>¡@</p>
