&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a half year's preparation and tens of millions of NT 
dollars' investment, the National Conference on Educational Development was held 
earlier this month. The conference was a big improvement over the one held nine 
years ago in terms of its format, topics and people involved. But it was a 
failure in many ways.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let's look at the topics chosen for the conference. 
This three pivotal topics were: increasing education opportunities for minority 
groups, promoting the quality and effectiveness of higher education and 
completing the phased 12-year compulsory education program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, these topics have failed to elicit concentrated 
discussion from all parties concerned as well as to address problems derived 
from the current education reform. Most of the suggestions made in the 90 or so 
regional forums held before the conference focused largely on the side of &quot;what 
ought to be,&quot; without a lot of clear analysis. Little has been said about 
conclusions made in the last conference, creating a sense of discontinuity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the conference did not really diagnose the current 
problems, especially those regarding the cultivation of teachers and their 
professional ability. As one academic pointed out, under the brunt of a 
knowledge-based eco-nomy, teachers are challenged by the urgency of reforms as 
well as complex learning results, rapidly changing society and redefinition of 
students' learning indices.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education reform needs to work with teachers in order to work 
well. Whether in promoting constructive mathematics or the Nine-year Educational 
Program, teachers' ability needs to be shifted or improved to cope with the new 
curriculum. Unfortunately, these issues have not been addressed in the 
conference.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polls conducted by the Ministry of Education and feedback 
from private groups have shown that problems are perceived in the process and 
direction of our education reform. The ideal of loosening school curriculums and 
lessening students' workload is impractical. Some criticize that our students 
are treated like guinea pigs. The reform has been implemented in such a rushed 
manner that parents barely have any idea about it and teachers have not improved 
their teaching ability along the way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, a national conference of this scale should 
effectively address these major issues that derive from the current education 
reform. It should not be an occasion where everyone has their say and that's it. 
Education is a fundamental task, crucial for generations to come. In an 
education conference like this, it is important for the<br>
attendees to address main issues with persuasive statistics. Therefore the 
conference itself should be equipped with a sound structure so that the agenda 
can proceed efficiently. Content conducted in a scientific manner with substance 
should also be provided so as to enable participants to review the past and make 
better decisions for<br>
the future. Giving away beautifully-printed booklets for the conference would 
not help much.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To review the education reform over the past 10 years would 
have been a more suitable and practical topic for the conference. As a NT$157 
billion five-year education reform program just came to an end this year, the 
government would have appeared more sincere in its determination to carry out 
the education reform if it had examined the reform in this conference.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our education reform puts too much emphasis on easing 
controls on the curriculum and lessening students' workload. The policy was 
pushed forward without going through standard procedures so the speed was too<br>
high and the scope too vast. That is why the objective of making our students 
happy and excellent becomes gradually impossible. Fairness and justice have also 
been unprecedentedly challenged during the reform.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conference could have been a great opportunity for us to 
examine these issues and set them straight. Unfortunately, the topics were 
inappropriate as they were proposed by the education authorities with a macro 
perspective. That is why the conference resulted in a discussion less relevant 
to the needs of the public.<br>
