Universitiy faculty members are expected to fulfill their roles in teaching, 
researching and community service, the latter role is even more demanded by the 
society in large for the sake of public justification, clarification, and the 
justice defense. Public intellectuals as Edward W. Said (1979) once pointed out 
that in facing any social conflicts, it is the duty of public intellectuals 
(including university faculty) to stand for their pursuit of truth and knowledge 
in the hope of maintaining social justice.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Ironically, Taiwanese professors like their counterparts in 
the West have busily devoted themselves to earn a living than to fulfill their 
social role as public intellectuals. Many of them have become less sensitive or 
even indifferent to expressing themselves over public issues. Along with their 
silence in the social domain, declines their professional status.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Nevertheless, gender issues in this regard have been ignored 
and, played a minor role in social discussions. The lack of gender awareness has 
been the case even in Said¡¦s major books on the role of public intellectuals. It 
is obvious that women experience a greater barrier in assuming their expected 
role as public intellectuals and academics owing to exclusion of discussion in 
literature and practice. In this paper, the author attempted to reviewed some 
case studies on the dilemma of female intellectuals in social participation.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US">The twenty-first century is the century where knowledge-based 
economy has formed the core of social development, where universities around the 
world has become the foundamental base and pawning ground for new knowledge and 
for human resources. In retrospect, Taiwan's higher education has evolved from 
elitist teaching to universal education, while suffered from lack of efficiency 
and social relevancy. Only in recent years, because of rapid social 
transformations, higher education also faces enormous trials and challenges, 
leading to the rise of a multitude of social problems and criticism. The call 
for revising University Law since 2000 has reflected current reform tendencies 
for restructuring Taiwanese universities, especially the national ones.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 18.0pt; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US">Therefore, a proposal has been launched by the government in 
the past two years to adjust national institutions into public legal persons, in 
the hope of relaxing national university governance while maintaining greater 
institutional autonomy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 18.0pt; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US">The current world- wide trend of higher education reform is 
ongoing as a result of governmental restructuring policies. As part of the 
reform programs, rationales of the incorporation of national universities has 
two folds in Great Britain, Germany and Japan: to enhance institutional 
efficiency on the one hand, and to maintain academic autonomy on the other. 
However, controversies have never ended over the transformation of national 
universities, which have been regarded as public goods, into a corporate status 
which economic efficiency first priority. The recent debates over the Taiwanese 
University Act drafting containing many items on incorporation of national 
universities ever easting. The message of the preceding this policy is clear and 
the attempt is strong in the eyes of administration, but not convincing enough 
from the university and other parties concerned owing to lack of communication 
and consensus. It is, thus, studies on this topic is very much needed, including 
the reform policy-making process, assumption underneath the policy, the 
infrastructure deployment of the new system, and the feasible evaluation 
outcomes of this new system in the future.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">The pursuit of quality in a knowledge-based 
economy is the top priority in the 21<sup>th</sup> century. It is even so for 
many developing countries such as China. According to Hamish Mcrae¡¦s (1996), 
study the top human traits in 2020 include creativity, quality, motivation, and 
discipline. Therefore, many school reforms are urged to update their curriculum 
and instruction in order to meet the needs of the competition within a 
knowledge-based society. This is especially true at the university level where 
students are expected creatively to apply their theories and knowledge aquired 
from the classroom into practice. In recent years, more and more Chinese 
universities are putting more efforts and resources on improving their students¡¦ 
creative abilities and performance by setting up many student innovation 
laboratories, or bases. In this study, three major university innovation 
application centers are reviewed. Issues discussed in the paper include the 
origin of the center establishment, daily operation of the programs, the profile 
of faculty and student involvement, and the evaluation of the program.</font></span></p>
