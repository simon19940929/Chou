		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: 新細明體">Since the global financial 
		tsunami hit Taiwan, the number of unemployed has exceeded 500,000, while 
		the number of those whose employment will be affected in some way will 
		soon break through 1 million. The situation is deteriorating for those 
		with hidden “atypical employment” such as dispatch and part-time jobs 
		and forced leave without pay. From the financial and technology 
		industries to the tourist hotel industry, large numbers of employees are 
		being laid off. Even people with master’s degrees are attending 
		employment fairs looking for low-end jobs such as waitering.<br>
		<br>
		How should college and university students react to Taiwan’s “new three 
		lows” — low interest rates, low salaries and low confidence? Can they 
		break through at a time when we still don’t know how deep the economic 
		downturn will be, and cultivate alternative skills that cannot be 
		substituted in the workplace?<br>
		<br>
		Many professors worry at the younger generation’s lack of ambition, lack 
		of foreign language ability, limited international perspective and 
		inability to meet challenges. Many selective courses with more 
		comprehensive content, a heavy workload and demanding teachers are often 
		canceled because of a lack of students or poor student feedback.<br>
		<br>
		This is because students want high scores — by listening to lectures 
		that do not require preparation — and do not want teachers checking 
		attendance. Students can graduate with a brilliant report card but 
		lacking the most basic abilities.Furthermore, students do not know how 
		to ask questions, nor do they like doing so. Only a few are able to 
		raise systematic questions and are willing to get to the bottom of a 
		matter or challenge the teacher.<br>
		<br>
		Of course, we cannot blame this on students alone. Because Taiwan’s 
		educational environment still focuses heavily on multiple choice 
		questions, elementary school learning focuses on memorizing fragmented 
		knowledge and drills.<br>
		<br>
		Students are so busy attending cram schools and private tutorials that 
		they have little opportunity for extracurricular reading or experiencing 
		real life. As a result, much of their learning is “false” because it 
		deteriorates into abstraction and meaningless rote learning, even as 
		they suffer from a lack of training logic and problem-solving skills.<br>
		<br>
		With this background, students feel that they cannot adapt to analysis 
		and criticism by university professors that allow no standard answers. 
		They often do not know how to ask questions, instead simply listening to 
		their teachers’ unchallenged lectures.<br>
		<br>
		Worse, as more and more students are accepted to university, many 
		students unsuitable for such studies enter and graduate because of low 
		entry thresholds.<br>
		<br>
		Meanwhile, many vocational senior colleges have given in to temptation 
		and upgraded to university-level institutions. Unfortunately, their 
		approach to education is in many cases not upgraded to reflect the 
		change. Instead, they lower their standards to attract students.<br>
		<br>
		University teachers are also required to do research and publish and are 
		pressured by schools to obtain doctoral degrees. Students who are in 
		need of remedial education and counseling are therefore easily passed 
		over and unable to develop personal skills and career goals.<br>
		<br>
		Can we nurture talent such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Yahoo 
		co-founder Jerry Yang (</span><span style="font-family: 新細明體">楊致遠<span lang="EN-US">)? 
		Where is the next Formosa Plastics Group founder Wang Yung-ching (</span>王永慶<span lang="EN-US">), 
		Evergreen Group chairman Chang Yung-fa (</span>張榮發<span lang="EN-US">) 
		or Hon Hai Group chairman Terry Gou (</span>郭台銘<span lang="EN-US">)? Can 
		universities or even secondary and elementary schools produce such 
		talent today?<br>
		<br>
		Let us begin with cultivating the habit of asking questions.<br>
