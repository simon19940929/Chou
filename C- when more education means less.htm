<font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A record 97.1 percent of candidates were 
accepted to colleges after this year’s national college entrance examination. 
But a more disturbing record was also set — the lowest exam score among those 
accepted was 7.69 points, a big drop from the previous record low of 18.47 
points set last year. The combination of falling birthrates and the 
proliferation of universities has meant more schools have found themselves short 
of students in recent years. To fill places, they have been lowering their 
entrance requirements every year. This year, however, was the first in which the 
lowest acceptance score added up to less than one point for each subject tested, 
suggesting the examinee basically gave up on the test. Yet the student shortfall 
for many colleges has reached a new high. Some could not even fill one-tenth of 
the available places. The total shortfall is 10 times greater than last year’s. 
This could be the prelude to a wave of closures among private colleges. How has 
it come to this? If college entrance exam results are a reliable measure of 
someone’s ability to go to university, what are we to make of a 7.96 score? 
Could it really be that senior and vocational high schools are completely 
failing to prepare their students for college? Does the problem lie with high 
school courses and teaching, or is it that high schoolers aren’t interested in 
their courses and are just drifting through school? What a waste of time for the 
students and for society. And what about the parents? Are they failing to 
properly appreciate their children’s inclinations and interests? Maybe they 
should consider letting their children go to technical or vocational schools, or 
go straight to work, where they can master work skills, instead of having them 
go to cram schools again and again and sit exams just to try to get a college 
degree. The shortage of applicants over the past three years has devalued the 
nation’s universities. It used to be assumed that going to university would 
enhance a person’s social mobility, improve his or her quality of life and boost 
employment prospects. The education reforms of the past decade, however, have 
led to a proliferation of senior high schools and universities. In the process, 
big differences have appeared between the top universities and the lesser ones 
both in terms of instruction and prospects for employment after graduation. The 
universities are coming to replicate and perpetuate the polarization between 
rich and poor. My own research indicates that the total costs of school fees and 
living expenses over four years of study come to about NT$1 million (US$31,800) 
for students at state-run universities and more than NT$1.3 million for those at 
private colleges. However, college graduates face high unemployment rates. 
Starting three or four years ago, the unemployment rate for college graduates 
has been higher than the overall jobless rate and well above that for people 
with other levels of education. Apart from calling for better quality education, 
perhaps parents and students should weigh up the relative opportunities and 
costs of going to college. All the more so considering that many people apply 
for student loans to attend private universities, saddling themselves with a 
heavy debt upon graduation. Such a financial burden can derail a person’s plans 
for work, marriage, buying a home and having children. So shouldn’t we be 
looking at alternatives to university? Otherwise, with a diploma in hand but no 
vocational or survival skills, many college graduates will find it hard to gain 
a foothold in society. As for those schools that are having trouble recruiting 
students, the government should not jusanzencourage them to close. They should 
consider other options, including restructuring or mergers and the legal 
framework governing higher education should be relaxed. Above all, avenues for 
working adults to engage in continuing education are limited, and the vocational 
qualification system has not been properly implemented. Since many adults have 
no way to pursue continuing education, people have no option but to enter higher 
education and get their qualifications when they are young, rather than gaining 
work skills first and going to college later. Japan began feeling the impact of 
falling birth rates a decade or more ago, and the Japanese have been 
implementing university restructuring and mergers for several years. Nearly four 
in 10 Japanese universities find it difficult to fill places. These universities 
have responded by offering different kinds of courses, reorganizing departments 
and targeting different groups for student recruitment, with many classes aimed 
at adults and retired people. What policies does Taiwan have to deal with the 
surfeit of universities, shortage of college applicants and falling entry 
requirements? Prudence Chou is a professor of education at National Chengchi 
University. &#08;TRANSLATED BY JULIAN CLEGG <br>
