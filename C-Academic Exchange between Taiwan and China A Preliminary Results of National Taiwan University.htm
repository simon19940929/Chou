This paper aimed to investigate the internationalization practices at the 
National Taiwan University (NTU) as representative of higher education 
institutions in Taiwan. In particular, it focused on the Chinese scholarly 
relations between Taiwanese scholars and their counterparts in mainland China 
and other countries. The authors of this paper attempted to initiate a dialogue 
about what it means for NTU scholars to be in a Chinese professoriate and to 
interact with other mainland and Chinese scholars. It explored NTU scholars’ 
perceived patterns and approaches of cooperation, and issues and challenges in 
the social interaction with mainland and Chinese scholars in a similar albeit 
different academic culture and discourse. The authors hope that the practical 
findings from the realities of the 14 interviewees at the NTU could add to the 
knowledge base for better understanding of the practices of Taiwanese higher 
education faculty in international partnerships with mainland and other overseas 
Chinese scholars. The findings indicate that </span>

increasingly reverse discrepancy among Taiwanese and Chinese academic 
qualifications and talents has aroused some concerns among the NTU participants. 
As China's economy progresses, higher education quality improves, and so the 
academics and students. A sense of anxiety and worry about the declining 
academic funding and quality in Taiwan is common among NTU participants when 
comparing with their Chinese counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

Literature on internationalization of higher education with an emphasis on 
academic exchange has a long interest in the structures and practices of Western 
higher education in, namely European countries, the United States, Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand（for example, Daly &amp; Barker,2005;Eldridge &amp; 
Wilson,2003;Meiras,2004;Peters,2003;Rizvi &amp; Walsh, 1998;Robertson &amp; 
Webber,2000;Saffu &amp; Mamman,1999; Wilson &amp; Robertson,1998,2003,2004）Issues of 
this phenomenon in the South-East Asia have traditionally been underrepresented. 
Recently, there is a growing interest in understanding the greater Chinese 
society, including Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Singapore, and in developing 
comparative education research in the Chinese context (Bray &amp; Qin, 
2001;Harding,1995).A number of scholars have endeavored in investigating the 
practices and outcome of change initiatives on higher education in Singapore, 
Hong Kong and China (for example,Chan &amp; Postiglione,1996;Gopinathan,2001; Mok &amp; 
Lee 2000; Mok &amp; Tan,2004; Mok &amp; Welch,2003;Ngok &amp; Kwang,2003; Post,2003; 
Sanderson,2002; Selvaratnam,1994 ).However, little has been known about the 
practices and impacts of change on higher education in Taiwan. Meanwhile, the 
call for regional cooperation among higher education institutions within and 
beyond the Asia region has widely extended in the academia. For Taiwan 
professoriate, cooperation and interaction between Taiwan, and mainland / other 
Chinese scholars plays a major role in aligning with the institution’s goal for 
internationalization, and in achieving the synergy and win-win situation in 
teaching and research development (Ho,2008). </span></p>
