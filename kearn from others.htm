<span lang="EN-US">Introduction</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Throughout 
the world teaching in higher education has traditionally been a male-dominated 
profession. Women have been a minority of instructors and professors at colleges 
and universities, even in countries where women represent over half of the 
students in higher education. As a minority, women have been segregated into the 
lower ranks, into part-time teaching and into the less lucrative and 'female' 
fields. Discrimination against women has occurred with respect to hiring, 
reward, promotion and granting tenure. Women have not been sponsored into the 
academic profession in the same ways as men have (Kelly, 1991).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">This 
chapter draws from two empirical studies on female faculty members in Taiwan 
(Chou, 1992; Chang, 1995). Women's participation in Taiwan's higher education 
serves as a good indicator for the modernization in the PRC's education system, 
and the findings of Taiwan studies therefore are relevant to the PRC. The 
purpose of this chapter is to analyse how and to what extent gender differences 
exist in the measures of hiring faculty staff, rewards and promotion in Taiwan, 
and to relate these findings to the PRC.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Status of Women in Taiwan</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
in many patriarchal societies, Chinese women have suffered from being treated as 
an inferior group and deprived of access to political power and economic 
independence (Young, 1973; Yao, 1983; Sheridan &amp; Salaff, 1984). The patrilineal 
descent principle operates as a major source of women's subordination. A strong 
preference for male children permeates Taiwan's society, as sons are seen as a 
potential source of support for their parents in old age, while helping to 
continue the family name. The general attitude towards women is reflected in 
common Chinese maxims, such as 'Male superior, female inferior' (zhong nan qing 
nu, </span>重男輕女<span lang="EN-US">) and 'Husband masters the public domain and 
wife masters the home' (nan zhu wai, nu zhu nei, </span>男主外，女主內<span lang="EN-US">). 
These traditional gender roles have been legitimized as stabilizers of both 
family and society in Taiwan's ideology.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Unlike 
their Western counterparts, Chinese women in the past were not organized to 
fight against their disadvantaged situation. As a result of the political 
revolution in 1911 and the May Fourth Movement in 1919, women started to play a 
more active role in the society and struggled to liberate themselves from the 
traditional value system (Yao, 1983; Ono, 1989). In education, women gained some 
privileges such as admittance to national universities and more opportunities in 
higher education.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Prior 
to 1895, the beginning of Japanese colonization, the position of women in Taiwan 
and the Mainland was quite similar in regards to lack of education, rigid 
kinship ties and absence of legal rights. Women were confined to their families 
before marriage and to their husbands afterwards (Robinson, 1975). Under the 
colonial policy from 1895 to 1945 when Taiwan was occupied by Japan, girls were 
allowed to attend primary schools to become literate, but were prevented from 
pursuing higher education. In 1945, when Taiwan returned to mainland China, many 
laws prevailing in mainland China were extended to Taiwan. A notable example is 
the 1947 Constitutional Law, which stated that all citizens of the Republic of 
China were equal in law, regardless of gender, religion, race and political 
party. Despite Taiwan's economic modernization that has expanded women's access 
to education and economic participation in the labour force, Confucian beliefs 
still prevail, and Taiwanese society remains strongly patriarchal. Persistence 
of traditional values and socialization processes perpetuate traditional sexrole 
differentiation (Chiang &amp; Ku, 1985). This traditional ideology and social role 
of women were rarely questioned until the 1970s, when a 'new generation' of 
Taiwanese emerged.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Economic Participation of Women in Taiwan</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Despite 
the traditional Chinese view of women as tied to home, several factors have 
given rise to new role expectations. These include a rise in women's overall 
educational level, technological advances that simplified housework, and a 
decline in fertility rates. As a result, women have entered the labour market in 
increasing numbers. The female labour force's participation rate in Taiwan 
increased from an average of 34% in the 1960s to 45% in 1993 (Statislical 
year-book of the Repuhlic of China, 1994). The share of female employment in 
total employment increased from 28% in 1951 to 38% in 1992 (Statiptical Yearbook 
of the Republic of China, 1993).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">With 
respect to salary differentials, women in Taiwan earned 42% of men's annual 
income in the labour market in 1964 and 57% in 1978 (Fei, et. al., 1982). In 
1991, on average, women earned less than 68% of the wages paid to men (Chang, 
1994). According to the 1982 Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, women with 
graduate school education were paid about 88% of salary paid to men with 
comparable education and 77% in 1991 (Chang, 1995). In 1988, the female/male 
earnings ratio for those with undergraduate education was about 2:3 and about 
1:2 for those with primary education. In 1991, it was 7.8:10 and 5.9:10 
respectively (Hsieh, 1995). Thus, the discrepancy in salary between men and 
women decreases as education level rises (Ben, 1985).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
earnings differential is attributed to differences in the employment structure. 
Female workers engage in relatively less attractive and less lucrative 
occupations, or at the lower end of production with less pay and less job 
security. Due to their responsibility for the family and their disrupted 
employment, women have less opportunity for promotion and are more likely to be 
concentrated at the lower levels of the occupational ladder.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">With 
respect to hiring, women face discrimination and unequal opportunities. In the 
government sector, women have faced relatively fewer barriers because the 
National Public Service Examination is open to both sexes. The proportion of 
women passing this examination has increased dramatically, from less than 4% in 
1950 to more than 50% in 1992. For example, in 1992, of the 6,995 people passing 
the examination, 59% were women in the Higher Level Examination; 81% of the 
6,018 people who qualified in the Ordinary Level Examination were women. 
Although women do not face formal obstacles in either examination, after passing 
the examinations they need to wait longer for a job assignment than men since 
the government often classifies the candidates. Moreover, equally qualified men 
have more opportunity to be assigned jobs in the government sector. Also, many 
private-sector employers and firms formulate unreasonable policies to keep out 
women. In private companies women are often forced to resign upon marriage or 
pregna ncy. Employers sometimes set quotas to protect the numbers of men in the 
various jobs and to keep the number of women low (Chen, 1993).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
sum, increased access to education has an important impact on female economic 
participation, female employment structure and female earnings. Continued 
expansion of educational opportunities for women would further expand their 
socio-economic participation and improve their social status. However, even 
after entering the job market, women face discrimination in training and 
promotion (Chang, 1995; Kuo, 1993). Equal opportunity in hiring, training and 
promotion for women is a prerequisite for the attainment of equality across 
gender. How to overcome the subtle gender bias in work and cope with personal 
life and career is one of the greatest challenges that women around the globe 
encounter today.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Empirical Research on Hiring Faculty Staff and The Academic 
Reward System</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">This 
section first reviews the process for hiring faculty staff and the academic 
reward system in Taiwanese higher education institutions. Then, it presents the 
results of two empirical studies.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Hiring faculty staff</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Hiring, 
evaluation and certification of faculty members are closely regulated by the 
Ministry of Education. All new faculty members start at the same rank and salary 
level in accordance with their qualifications.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
recruitment of personnel in a department is usually handled by its chairperson, 
who screens the applications and nominations, then&nbsp; submits his or her selection 
to an ad hoc committee for further evaluation. In recent years, with an 
increasing push for academic democratization, the ad hoc committee has started 
playing an important role in the first step of the hiring process by reviewing 
all the applications. However, the chairperson still remains very influential in 
the decision process in the department. The ad hoc committee, in turn, submits 
its recommendation to the dean of the college for final approval. Finally, the 
dean's decision is submitted to the university senate for endorsement. Once the 
senate approves the hiring decision, the Ministry of Education sets the rank and 
grants the newly hired faculty member a teaching certificate.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
screening criteria (such as qualifications) are based upon the subjective 
judgement of the chair and the ad hoc committee. Their perceptions may be 
distorted, for example, by personal prejudice against women. The chair may be 
authoritarian and monopolistic, and may exercise personal favouritism and 
nepotism in hiring. Thus, departments may recruit not simply on the basis of 
qualification, but also according to gender preference. To determine the extent 
to which this practice occurs, this study looks at the attitudes of both the 
department chair and the ad hoc committee members in the hiring process.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
1995, a survey was conducted among current and former department chairs and 
professors who were on ad hoc hiring committees in the 11 fields of study in 33 
higher institutions in Taiwan (N=283). They were given ten fictitious job 
resumes describing the applicants and were asked to complete a questionnaire1. 
According to the survey, the most important stated criteria in hiring faculty 
staff in Taiwan wre the candidate's publications and education. The second and 
third important criteria were work experience and age respectively, followed by 
familiarity and alumni status. The marital status and gender of the applicant 
were not reported as very important.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">To 
determine whether gender in fact made a difference in the hirability ratings for 
each candidate, a summary rating of the four measures of applicant's hirabi lity 
(competency, attractiveness as colleague, general desirability and the 
reviewer's inclination to hire the candidate) was calculated for each candidate. 
No significant difference appeared when candidates were represented as women or 
men. No personal characteristic, for example, rank, educational background, 
country of earned degree, teaching and administrative experience, age, 
department, institution-showed a consistent pattern of strong gender preference 
in hiring faculty staff.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Income and promotion</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
remuneration paid to full-time university teachers in Taiwan consists of salary 
and allowances. Salary corresponds to position, concurrent administrative work 
and professional experience. Allowances apply to food, housing and research2. 
Outside income is also an important form of academic reward, as many faculty 
members serve as paid-consultants to outside business enterprises.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
four ranks in the faculty hierarchy in the early 1990s were teaching assistant, 
lecturer, associate professor and full professor. Given a teacher's good record 
and specialized publications, the minimal number of four years of service is 
required for a teaching assistant to become a lecturer; at each step at least 
three years are needed before a lecturer can become an associate professor and 
then be promoted to a full professor. Ideally, promotion should be based on 
performance in teaching, research and service. In reality, however, teaching 
performance is difficult to measure; research productivity is usually evaluated 
by only one representative work; and the priority given to service during an 
academic career varies over time. Consequently, seniority has become a surrogate 
for performane and the major criterion for rank promotion.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
1990, a survey with interviews collected various data, including academics' 
personal attitudes towards the academic reward system3. Female faculty members 
had a lower total income than their male counterparts, even after demographic, 
educational and work variables were taken into consideration. Not surprisingly, 
the survey found that those who held a higher academic rank assumed higher-level 
administrative positions, published more books and articles, worked in a public 
institution or engaged in community service, and were more likely to have a 
higher total income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Concerning 
promotion, academics who either (1) did not have a doctoral degree, or (2) had 
earned their degrees from domestic institutions, (3) majored in non-natural 
sciences, or (4) were not in administration took more time to advance to the 
rank of professor. Women tended to spend more years before being promoted to the 
rank of professor than to that of associate professor. Women encountered fewer 
chances to be promoted at the senior stage than at the junior rank.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
reward system (income and promotion) appears to be fair and objective. Women's 
lower achievement was very much shaped by forces from different directions, 
family influence in particular. Men and women experience different career 
patterns and treatment in academe. Marriage facilitated men's academic career 
while inhibiting women's achievement in academe.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Results</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Gender 
differentiation is entrenched in income and promotion in the academic sector. As 
compared to their male counterparts, female faculty members tend to spend more 
years before achieving the professor rank and earn a lower total income. Male 
faculty members have more publications, more access to higher administrative 
positions, community services and social networks. Consequently, men are more 
visible in the field, receive more recognition and allowances from institutions 
and have more presence in the decision-making process. Social networking in 
academe results in more outside income for male than female faculty members. 
Whether there is gender discrimination in Taiwan's academic reward system is 
still a question to be answered. Nevertheless, female faculty members, on the 
average, are promoted slower and earn less.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Women 
often lack the encouragement and opportunities to tap into the social and 
information networks which are vital for occupational attainment, especially in 
a society loke Taiwan where much information tends to travel through informal 
channels. In academe, as in other sectors of society, success is often affected 
by not only what you know but whom you know; not only by hard work, but also by 
guidance, support and advocacy from those who are already established in the 
system. The exclusion of women from the information network and their 
underrepresentation in faculties contribute to unequal opportunities for women 
,who cannot translate their educational attainments into gains in the academic 
market-place.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Comparison between Taiwanese and Mainland University Women</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Since 
1950 female graduates in the PRC have had relatively equal job opportunities 
under the socialist job assignment system. This is also the case in academe 
where female professionals are relatively well represented compared to their 
counterparts in other Asian countries (Hayhoe, 1996). Returnees from study 
abroad working in northwest China, for example, reported they experienced no 
career barriers caused by their gender (Hayhoe, 1996). Similarly, the Taiwanese 
women in the faculty study discussed above reported being aware of no 
discrimination in the hiring process. To date research has been limited in scope 
and the data in both cited studies are by no means representative. They 
nevertheless raise the question: are the interviewees just too successful to 
have experienced gender discrimination in their career? How aware of 
discrimination are the faculty members? For both Taiwan and the PRC, true gender 
equality in the hiring of faculty staff has yet to be established. As Stanley 
Rosen and many others have critiqued, the reforms in the post-Mao era have 
created a context unprecedented since 1949 which legitimated not only the 
traditional attitudes against women, but also the explicit gender discrimination 
in employment and education (Andors, 1993). A great deal of survey data suggest 
that the economic reforms have in fact contributed to gender inequality in the 
PRC (Zhongguo Funu Bao, 26 April, 1989). Women continue to be excluded from 
employment and education as Chinese modernization proceeds.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
PRC Education Law issued on 18 March 1995 reimposes gender equality in 
education. '...Citizens under the law should have equal educational 
opportunities regardless of ethnicity, race, gender... (item 9) and...' schools 
and related departments should ensure that females and males are treated equally 
when it comes to school admission, further studying, job employment, awarding 
academic degrees, and selecting people for overseas study' (item 36) (Zhongguo 
Jiaoyu Bao, 22 march, 1995). The passage of the law, of course, does not 
guarantee its effective implementation or cause an attitude change in the 
society to reverse the perceived inferior position of women. Despite family 
obstacles and traditional values that work against women, the current social 
structure and public policies on economic reform in the PRC also appear to have 
a negative impact on women's employment opportunities. In fact, many reports 
show that Chinese college women have experienced increasing discrimination in 
employment since the 1980s.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
a result of the recent modifications in the centralized job assignment system, 
coupled with increasing enterprise autonomy, more and more employers tend to 
hire male graduates rather than their female counterparts (Jiang, 1998; Rosen, 
1992). College women are considered by many employers to be less creative, more 
arrogant and hard to deal with. An investigation conducted in Shanghai in 1988 
shows that more than 50% of female graduates were rejected by their prospective 
hiring units (Su, 1989). Younger women also consider the increasingly explicit 
gender inequality as a serious social issure (Zhongguo Funu, 1, Jan, 1989). With 
respect to academic women, the case can also be applicable to their profession. 
Many surveys conducted in the PRC reveal that women are less likely to be hired 
in the profession, have less opportunity to be promoted to the top positions, 
are underrepresented among those with the highest degree, and tend to cluster in 
more female-traditional fields (Rosen, 1992). For example, among members 
selected for the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, women 
accounted for only 4% (26 out o f 644) in 1985 (Hunan Resources Research 
Institute, 1986).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Another 
example is that the recruitment of female scientists in the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences declined in the mid-1980s (to less than one-third); so did women 
recruits in other state-owned scientific and technical departments (Lilu, 1988). 
Statistics also show that the higher the position, the greater the discrepancy 
between men and women (Lilu, 1988). The percentage of female professionals 
declines as one moves up the career ladder. Although there is no direct evidence 
to show that women face gender discrimination in faculty hiring, it is obvious 
that, in the post-Mao reform era, more and more female graduates have been less 
likely to be hired by the work- unit</span>－<span lang="EN-US">let alone develop 
their career in academe. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Though 
no actual statistics show that Mainland female faculty members earn less than 
their male counterparts, the increasing pressure from market reform has a great 
negative impact on female professionals. For example, from the 1980s, many 
Mainland universities have struggled to make extra income to improve faculty 
members' salaries. In addition to a fixed institutional salary, faculty members 
now receive benefits from other sources, such as fees from self-supporting 
students, research contracts with enterprises, and profit from school-run 
factories. Men tend to have a greater network for outside opportunities and are 
more likely to engage in research projects with outside sources. While 
achievements are necessary for academic reward, women are not put into a 
position to demonstrate their abilities. Female faculty members are expected to 
take up much of the teaching, lower-level administration and household and 
parenting chores (Hayhoe, 1996). The latter activities are not as well rewarded 
as the former ones, and income discrepancy between male and female academics in 
PRC is visible, if not statistically definable.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Housing 
is also an important issue in the academic reward system. In many Mainland 
universities, female faculty members qualify for on-campus housing only after 
they reach the rank of associate professor, whereas men are provided with 
accommodation at the rank of teaching assistant. This double standard reflects 
the value that men's career development carries more weight than women's in 
Mainland academe (Hayhoe, 1996). Another example shows the unequal treatment of 
men and women. The retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women. As one 
approaches retirement, opportunities become fewer and fewer for women than men, 
while pressures increase. Consequently, women do not move up as much as their 
male counterparts (Zhngguo Funu Bao, 31 march, 1986).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">For 
both Taiwanese and Mainland female faculty members, a graduate degree is crucial 
to promotion. In Taiwan, a doctoral degree is essential for female professionals 
in academic employment, research, high-level administrative positions, and for 
rank advancement (Chou, 1992). Compared to their Taiwanese counterparts, 
Mainland female faculty members also face difficulties in promotion. As the 
current criteria for promotion emphasize formal graduate degrees and research 
productivity, women are disadvantaged because they are less likely to hold a 
graduate degree or to publish. Consequently, women's rank promotion tends to be 
slower than their male counterparts.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Conclusion</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Gender 
differences exist in the measures of academic rewards and promotion in Taiwan. 
Although empirical studies do not show a consistent pattern of strong gender 
preference in the resume-evaluation stage of hiring faculty members, due to the 
imperfection of this evaluation technique, discrimination possibly exists; more 
comprehensive research is needed.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Regarding 
the status of female faculty members in Taiwan and the PRC, both groups share 
commonalties in their academic careers. The status of contemporary Taiwanese and 
Mainland women reflects a mixture of traditional values coupled with modified 
ideas about women and their role in society. Although female faculty members are 
generally highly educated, better informed and represent the elite levels of the 
society, many of them are still confronting traditional gender prejudice or 
discrimination at work.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
terms of educational achievement, the progress of women in Taiwan and the PRC 
has increased at all levels of education over the past four decades. 
Specifically in higher education, Taiwan's female participation increased almost 
fourfold, form 11% in 1951 to 43% in 1994. The attainment rate of Mainland women

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
role of education in developing both a just and an efficient society has long 
been a controversial issue (Inkeles, 1975). In China, this debate over social 
equity and economic growth has varied from time to time according to the 
ideology of those in political power. The central argument developed in this 
chapter is that in China, family background has continued to affect one's 
educational opportunity and inequality has resulted regardless of the state's 
intervention in university admissions policies. This chapter will first describe 
the college entrance systems during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and 
post-Cultural Revolution (1977-present ) periods. Next the paper will examine 
the effects of these two sets of admission policies on the distribution of 
Chinese university students according to their family backgrounds or social 
class. Further, this treatise will discuss the strong influence of family 
background on one's educational opportunities, regardless of different state 
interventions in universit y admissions. Finally, the chapter will conclude that 
social inequality in higher education has been maintained both during the 
Cultural Revolution and in the post-Cultural Revolution periods. </span></font>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">This 
chapter focuses on the relationship of admissions policies to the unequal social 
class distribution of university students in China. Equal access to education is 
defined here as &quot;the provision of similar educational facilities for all 
students at least up to the age of labor market entry,&quot; which is generally age 
thirteen (Levin, 1976). After that age, further education would depend on 
previous educational achievement and personal choice. In a Marxist view, where 
there is equal educational opportunity, there should not be any social 
classrelated factors to prevent students of lower-class origins from taking 
advantage of higher education ( Zhuang, 1987). Even though higher education is 
restricted to students with certain levels of academic achievement, all students 
nonetheless have the opportunity to compete for admission to a university.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Family 
Background. Traditionally, the Chinese communist government has divided the 
population into three broad classes; 1) landlords/capitalists, 2) intellectuals, 
and 3) workers/peasants. The first group consists of those who were landlords, 
rich peasants, industrialists and capitalists before the communist takeover in 
1949. &quot;Intellectuals&quot; refer to those well-educated people engaged in cultural 
work: artists, musicians, teachers, university professors, etc. Workers and 
peasants are manual laborers and comprise the largest category, including over 
80% of the population (Whyte, 1975). The party cadres (i.e., communist party 
members) and soldiers closely identify themselves with peasants and workers. 
They have benefited from &quot;affirmative action&quot; in China since 1949 (Shirk, 1982).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Selection 
System. There have been two divergent systems used in university admissions in 
China over the past forty years, depending on the prevailing ideology. Different 
criteria were established during consecutive political eras. The &quot;examination 
model&quot; was invented along with the state universities or academies in China 
around 200 B. C. and had served as a tool for recruiting men for civil service 
positions until 1905 (Ho, 1962). During 1949-1966 and during the post-Cultural 
Revolution period (1977-present), Chinese universities recruited secondary 
school students upon graduation according to their test scores on the national 
standardized entrance exams. During 1970-1976, the &quot;recommendation model&quot; 
required students to have a minimum of two years work experience and academic 
qualifications equivalent to secondary schooling. All applicants, however, were 
selected by their work units according to individual political performance, work 
units according to individual political performance, work record, social/origin, 
and academic potential (Shirk, 1982; Wang, 1987).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
Cultural Revolution (or The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution). During 
1966-1976 the educational system was attacked by Mao Zedong (Tse-tung) and his 
allies. The priority of Maoist leadership was economic and educational equity, 
which emphasized the rapid expansion of primary and secondary education 
(especially in the rural areas) rather than higher level training and research 
(Shirk, 1982). The political campaign and social movement which began in 1966 
resulted in the closing of many higher education institutions and secondary 
schools. Students were enlisted in the Red Guard (as political revolutionaries 
and activists) to purge the society of political rightists and revisionists. 
When universities again opened in the early 1970s &quot;new stress was placed on the 
study of Marxism, Leninism, and the Thought of Mao Zedong-that is, on political 
indoctrination ... which advocated the downgrading of academic elitism&quot; (Clubb, 
1978, pp. 149). A year after Mao's death in 1976, the pre-cultural Revolution 
admissions practices were restored. College entrance examinations were held on a 
provincial and municipal basis in 1977, and have been conducted on a national, 
unified basis subsequently since 1978.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Selection Systems During the Cultural Revolution</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Before 
1966, access to university education was based on an examination system, solely 
on academic criteria. However, during the Cultural Revolution, the college 
entrance examination system was abolished and political considerations 
prevailed. Chinese education policy began to place emphasis on political 
training, commitment to socialism, and practical work experience as 
qualifications for admission to a university. Higher education also emphasized 
the inclusion of previously underrepresented populations such as workers, 
peasant, and soldiers. In the early period of this movement (1966-1970), most 
tertiary (higher education) institutions did not recruit new students due to 
political turmoil. The college entrance examination system was abolished because 
it favored the children of bourgeois intellectuals and capitalists, excluding 
most candidates from worker/peasant families (Hawkins, 1983; Thomas, 1983). 
After 1970 the recommendation system started to enroll students according to 
&quot;affirmative action policy&quot; for workers and peasants, regardless of their 
intellectual aptitude and educational preparation. Social class became a major 
determinant for admission to higher education (Hawkins, 1983).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">During 
this period, college applicants were no longer required to take entrance 
examinations. Instead, candidates who worked at least two years on a farm or in 
a factory were qualified to be recommended through their colleagues in the work 
unit or local party. The criteria for recommendation was based on work attitudes 
and political activism, rather than academic achievement. Children of workers, 
peasants, and soldiers had priority for recommendation and selection (Sobhe, 
1982; Yao, 1984). Through this system, much more people from underrepresented 
worker/peasant family backgrounds gained the opportunity to go to college (Broaded, 
1983). This was especially true at the beginning of the recommendation system.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US"><b>Selection Systems During the Post-Cultural Revolution</b>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">After 
Mao's death in 1976, a new efficiency and quality oriented policy was favored 
again by the dominant leadership group. Consequently, one of the most important 
measures in re-organizing the education system after the Cultural Revolution was 
the restoration of the college entrance examination system. During this period 
educational policy emphasized meritocracy and used examinations for screening. 
Although examination scores were considered the most important criteria for 
selection, candidates were also required to pass political and physical 
screening in the first few years (Shirk, 1982). Later, performance in entrance 
examinations became the crucial determining factor, regardless of work 
experience and other previous requirements.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to Wang (1987), there are four characteristics of Chinese college entrance 
examinations. The first one is the exam's predominant position in the college 
admission process, compared to the recommendation system used during the 
Cultural Revolution. The administration of national college entrance 
examinations has been regarded as an objective, impersonal, impartial, and 
reliable practice which can guarantee a candidate's intellectual ability. 
Because of this high regard the examination system has gained strong public 
support in China.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
second feature of the entrance exam system is its nationally unified pattern. In 
order to organize higher learning efficiently, and to standardize teaching 
programs in secondary schools throughout the country, China implemented unified 
examinations on a national basis. The third characteristic of the entrance exam 
system is its keen competition among the candidates. One of the reasons for this 
stiff compeition is the exam's low passing ratio relative to most of the other 
countries in the world. In 1978 about 4.7 million candidates sat for the exams, 
and only 28 thousand (one out of sixteen) were admitted to college (Bratton, 
1979; Chang, 1982; Wang, 1987; Yao, 1984). In recent years, efforts have been 
made to reduce the keenness of competition. One way is to reduce the number of 
potential candidates; another is to increase college enrollment. However, 
competition is still keen due to a vast population of high school graduates.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
final characteristic is that the exam contents are &quot;book-knowledge&quot; oriented, 
only testing a candidate's knowledge of specific secondary curricula. This 
narrowly defined scope of exam content for university admission leads the lower 
schools, teachers, and students to focus on knowledge regarding exam subjects 
rather than on all-around development. In other words, they are motivated to 
gear classroom activities toward performance on the examinations.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Admission Criteria and Social Equity</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">China's 
two admissions policies systems (by recommendation or examination) have 
different outcomes with regard to social equity and discrimination in access to 
universities. Because of the strong emphasis on test scores and academic 
achievement, the college entrance examinations benefit children from 
intellectual family backgrounds most. The exam's strong linkage to the access to 
quality secondary education can produce patterns of admissions that are quite 
unfavorable to working-class children and rural residents in China, where 
educational resources are very unevenly distributed (Bratton, 1979; Kwong, 
1983). Moreover this system can also disfavor those youths who engaged more in 
political activities than in school study. This is why the college exam system 
was criticized as being biased in favor of the bourgeois class. Children of 
urban intellectuals and officials received a disproportionate share of 
university admissions because of abilities they acquired from their parents and 
the advantage of attending better secondary schools in urban areas (Kwong, 1983; 
Shirk, 1982).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
recommendation system, on the other hand, has the ability to overcome these 
disadvantages because it gives consideration to class background and political 
commitment. However, in practice this system has favored children from worker 
and peasant backgrounds, as well as the children of party officials (Broaded, 
1983; Shirk, 1982). The recommendation system can also balance the distribution 
of students from fural and urban backgrounds through entry quotas in every work 
unit.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Nevertheless, 
in implementing these affirmative action policies, the recommendation system was 
affected by some undesired bias in the selection process. The selection 
authorities were supposed to consider an applicant's family background as well 
as individual political commitment. However, vague and subjective standards made 
this lofty and artificial ideal of a strictly egalitarian educational policy 
unachievable in full (Shirk, 1982). A major criticism in the later years of the 
Cultural Revolution was that the use of students' commitment to socialism as a 
criterion for evaluation and recommendation became suspicious. It was very 
difficult to judge one's political commitment. In reality, favoritism was the 
prevailing criteria. The crucial recommendations by one's fellow workers and the 
administrative leaders (especially the latter) were difficult to obtain. To get 
a recommendation meant to gain favor with the administrators in the work unit. 
As a result, by the mid-seventies favoritism (&quot;going through the back door,&quot; 
corruption, bribery, etc.) became widespread. A student's relationship with his 
administrators and coworkers, and his parents' occupations and family 
connections all became crucial factors in being admitted to a university. Thus, 
more and more of the students who were recommended and admitted were children of 
top-level party officials rather than those from disadvantaged family 
backgrounds. Although some of the party cadres were from worker/peasant 
background, they were a small group compared to the large number of ordinary 
workers and peasants. Attending a university thus became the privilege of those 
with political power (Kwong, 1983).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
direct correlation between commitment to socialism and qualification to higher 
education was also questionable. Universities should theoretically recruit 
students based on the merits of their academic preparation rather than merely on 
their political ideology (Kwong, 1983). This policy of abandoning exam scores 
and discriminating against students from intellectual family background 
effectively denied access to some well-prepared candidates. On the other hand, 
many students with poor academic preparation were admitted because of their 
&quot;red&quot; family background (i.e., party member connections). In an effort to 
produce equity, the state was over-emphasizing the requirement of worker/peasant 
family background. Even if an applicant from an intellectual family declared 
him- or her-self as a worker after spending many years in a factory, his/her 
family connection was still suspected by hisher work unit leader. Therefore, an 
intellectual's chance of being recommended to a tertiary institution was 
minimal, regardless of his/her work performance and academic achievement.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
short, without an objective standard of selection or a strict set of academic 
qualifications required by universities, the quality of staff and students 
declined during the Cultural Revolution (Hawkins, 1983; Thomas, 1983; Yao, 
1984). Initial egalitarian intentions about equality in Chinese higher education 
for workers and peasants thus were not achieved.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Effects of the Selection System on Student Background</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
abolition of entrance examinations was supposed to make universities more 
accessible to peasants and workers during the Cultural Revolution. However, did 
the recommendation system really benefit those workers and peasants? Were more 
of them admitted to universities during this period? In the early 1970s there 
was relative growth in the number of students from worker or peasant families 
admitted to tertiary institutions. At Northwestern University in Xi'an, for 
example, 42% of students were reported to be from worker families and 35% to be 
of peasant origin in 1973. At Beijing University 80-90% of students were 
reported to be from worker or peasant family backgrounds in 1973-1974 (White, 
1981). According to another report which took a content analysis of articles 
from the Renmin Ribao (People's Daily) during 1971, 1975 and 1978, there were 
many students from worker, peasant, and soldier backgrounds from 1971 to 1975 (Broaded, 
1983). Table 1 summarizes students' social backgrounds.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
data from 1971 and 1975 provide some support for the recommendation policy 
rationale for increasing access by workers and peasants to the university during 
the Cultural Revolution (Broaded, 1983). However, it is hard to apply these data 
to the numbers of actual workers and peasants. As Ann Kent suggests, many 
students were children of the privileged party cadre, who spent two or three 
years in the countryside before coming to universities (Kent, 1981). Further, 
many students classified as being from a peasant background in the mid 1970s 
were probably the &quot;sent-down youth&quot; (&quot;Xiafang qingnian&quot;), who originally lived 
in urban areas and were sent to the countryside to do physical labor. After 
working in rural areas for several years, they were then re-classified as 
peasants. This group comprised a large proportion of all university students 
(Bratton, 1979; Broaded, 1983).</span></font></p>

this trend changed after the re-institution of college entrance examinations in 
1977 (i.e., during the post-Cultural Revolution period). The proportion of 
students from intellectual family backgrounds (especially party officials), who 
were admitted to tertiary institutions steadily increased and has even become 
the dominant population in many universities since then (Bratton, 1979; Kwong, 
1983; Sidel, 1982; White, 1981). According to Table 1, the percentage of 
students with intellectual backgrounds increased from 0.9% in 1971, and 15% in 
1975, to 43% in 1978. Although one may not generalize these findings to the rest 
of the student population because of the small sample size (n=250), the 
percentage of students from intellectual backgrounds did increase after the 
re-institution of the exam system in 1977. Nevertheless, in Chinese official 
government statements one can hardly see any record of university students' 
social backgrounds, As a Chinese journalist mentioned:</span></font></p>

it is difficult to resolve the problems of releasing the family it is difficult 
to resolve the problems of releasing the examination system after 1977. 
According to an attitude survey of 653 respondents in Shanghai, the opportunity 
for students from various family backgrounds to enter universities differed 
substantially. Most respondents believed that children from intellectual or 
party official family backgrounds had more than a 70% chance to go to college, 
while those from worker and peasant backgrounds only had a 25% chance (Zhuang, 
1987). Although perceptions of access to higher education may be different from 
the actual facts regarding student family backgrounds, these attitudes may 
reflect the reality of educational inequality in Chinese society. Other research 
shows that 80% of Chinese graduate students (from Mainland China) in Los Angeles 
come from intellectual family backgrounds in China's urban and coastal areas. 
The respondents estimated that around 70-80% of their university classmates came 
from intellectual and party official families (Chou, 1989). This percentage may 
be even higher. Other research involving interviews of 30 students and graduates 
in China has found that almost all (n=29) were from intellectual and party 
official family backgrounds (Kwong, 1983).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Since 
access to higher education depends on the college entrance examinations, 
academic performance plays a crucial part. Given China's unequal distribution of 
educational resources, children from intellectual and party cadre family

peasant backgrounds.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Summary and Conclusion</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to Marxist theory social background should not affect one's educational 
opportunity. However in China, during the last four decades of Marxist Socialism 
family backgrounds have continued to influence a citizen's chances to gain 
access to higher education: there is still a large amount of inequality in 
access to quality schooling and high status occupations (Zhuang, 1987). Since 
the founding of the People's Republic of China, the great debate over equity and 
growth has been highly controversial (Hawkins, 1983; Yao, 1984). Education has 
always been regarded as one of the important tools to achieve national goals. 
However, family background still affects educational opportunity, producing 
inequality despite state intervention in university enrollment processes. Social 
inequalities in higher education have remained both during and after the 
Cultural Revolution. The recommendation system used during the Cultural 
Revolution initially favored worker and peasant children for the purpose of 
compensating the deprived and oppressed classes. But this system deteriorated 
due to pervasive corruption and lack of an objective standard, creating &quot;new 
inequalities&quot; based on political rather than academic criteria.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">After 
1977 the Chinese government shifted its national policies to economic 
development, emphasizing efficiency. The new examination system only rewards 
academic achievement and merit, providing an avenue to tertiary education which 
is far more favorable to students from intellectual backgrounds. This 
examination system measures not only the level of training acquired in schools 
but also knowledge, training, and social skills acquired in the family setting 
(Bernstein, 1977). With coaching and support from parents, students of 
intellectual families perform better on the examination and hence progress 
further in the educational system. Thus they are rewarded with better future 
life opportunities. Students of worker/peasant background who are less prepared 
for schooling than their counterparts from intellectual and party cadre families 
do not perform as well on the entrance examinations and thus have little chance 
to go to college. As a result the examination system not only maintains but even 
enhances the in itial inequality between the intellectual/cadre families and 
those with worker/peasant social origins.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
conclusion, both social equity and economic growth have played conflicting roles 
consecutively in Chinese higher education for the past four decades. Different 
national goals have resulted in widely different objectives for education, 
varying from social engineering and political commitment to academic achievement 
and economic progress. One's family background still affects his/her access to 
higher education. The government needs policies which will balance the conflict 
of social equity and economic growth, while maintaining a high quality of 
education and providing more opportunities to people from various family 
backgrounds. Educational inequality will continue to plague Chinese society 
until this dilemma is resolved.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Introduction</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
a result of affirmative action in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, 
one might expect that women had made substantial progress in achieving equity in 
academe (Finkelstein,1984a; Simeone, 1987). While there has been an increase in 
hiring new femal doctorates as faculty members, women still hold only about 28% 
of all faculty positions, tend to be concentrated in &quot;traditionally female&quot; 
fields, earn approximately $6,000 less than men, hold positions one fourth or 
one fifth of a step lower in rank, and play a lesser role in administration and 
governance than their male counterparts in all universities (Finkelstein, 1984b; 
Chamberlain, 1988; Watkins, 1990; Strohm, 1990; Astin, 1991).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
Taiwan, women make up the largest proportion of teachers from kindergarten to 
senior high school, while men hold higher administrative positions. In 1990, for 
example,women constituted approximately 55% of the teacher population in middle 
and elementary schools,but made up only 28% of university faculty members (see 
Table 1). More specifically, they accounted for 9% of the professors, 18% of the 
associate professors, 40% of the instructors, and53% of the teaching assistants 
(Ministry of Education, 1991). This rank distribution for female faculty 
indicates that: 1) academe is still a male-dominated occupation; 2) the higher 
the rank, the fewer women at that rank (Yao, 1983).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
fact, the Taiwan government has enforced policies such as &quot;equal pay for equal 
work&quot; and a centralized and fixed salary system across all fields of specialty 
(Ministry of Education, 1991). Nevertheless, gender bias still exists within 
universities in Taiwan(Sha, 1987). For example, with respect to total income, 
female faculty members earn about$120,000 in New Taiwan dollars (or $4,000 in 
U.S. dollars) less per year than their male counterparts regardless of field, 
rank, degree, or administrative position (Lin, 1987). Female faculty members 
also hold very few administrative positions in Taiwan. Women do not head any 
university; they comprise 3% of treasury directors, 1% of college deans, 5% of 
graduate deans, and 9% of department chairs (Hsu, 1990).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">One 
may speculate that as a result of having so few women in administrative 
positions, the issue of gender differences in the academic reward system 
continues to be neglecte and rarely discussed despite Taiwan's great efforts and 
emphasis on social equity an equal opportunities in the development of human 
resources.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Research on the Academic Reward System</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to Tuckman (1979), the academic reward system consists of at least four 
categories of rewards and leads to increasing monetary compensation, social 
prestige, and career opportunities. These four categories are: 1) the 
institutional salary; 2) the non-material rewards of personal satisfaction (such 
as feedback from students and recognition from peers); 3) promotion to a higher 
rank due to professional merits and accomplishments in research, teaching, and 
service; and 4) optional access to career advancement in administration, to 
research grants and private consulting, and to opportunities of recreuitment by 
private corporations or by the government. These four forms of rewards are by no 
means mutually exclusive, although some of them are difficult to verify and 
measure.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Among 
these rewards, salary is the most frequently investigated. For example, prior 
research found that years of experience, along with years of schooling, 
productivity, and gender, are significant predictors of faculty salary (Finklestein, 
1984b). With years of schooling and experience held constant, female faculty 
earn 15 to 25% less than males with the same characteristics (Reagan &amp; Maynard, 
1974; Hoffman, 1976). An unconscious devaluation of women's role in the academic 
market is found to contribute to the salary discrepancies between men and women. 
As finklestein reports, over fifty major studies conducted during the last 
decade come to the same conclusion: the salary structure in the United Stated 
differs significantly for men and women. The latter are paid less ever after 
partialling out the effects of rank, type of institution, and field of study. 
This income disparity between men and women academics continues to increase 
throughout their academic career (Finklestein, 1984a).</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Theoretical Framework for Gender Differences in the Academic 
Reward System</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
order to construct a theoretical framework to account for reward differentials 
between male and female faculty, the investigator summarized prior research 
findings into the following two categories: 1) overt discrimination as a result 
of gender; and 2) differential performance between men and women.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">1. Overt Discrimination Based on Gender:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
following studies argue that academe has a double standard, which underestimates 
women's performance and rewards them less favorably than men (Kahn &amp; Robbins, 
1985).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">1) 
Gender Role Stereotypes and Lack of Comparable Worth:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Many 
employers assume that women will be inconsistent participants in the labor force 
due to family obligations. As a result, they tend to reward women less than they 
do men in salary, rank and promotion (John &amp; Stafford, 1974; Farber, 1977). In a 
study of faculty salaries at the University of Michigan, Fox (1981) incorporates 
an &quot;ideology of achievement&quot; framework into her analysis.</span>　<span lang="EN-US"> 
Since American society emphasizes &quot;achievement&quot; to a great extent, people are 
supposed to be rewarded according to their ability and performance at work 
regardless of gender. However, while achievements are the income indicator, a 
dual reward structure between men and women legitimated by achievement ideology 
exists. Consequently, men and women do not receive &quot;comparable income&quot; for 
comparable achievenment in academe.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">2) 
Institutional Discrimination:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Academe, 
like other professions, has its hierarchical arrangements, culture, and 
credentialism. Since male faculty have been the majority in this profession, 
their work constitutes the main body of the literature, their access to 
resources is greater, and the current academic reward system has evolved over 
time according to their needs in the community (Finkelstein, 1984a). As a 
result, academic structure reinforces men's predominant culture, and 
under-estimates women's contributions to the profession.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">3) 
The Oldboy Network and Interpersonal Relationships:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
&quot;oldboy network&quot; is a term referring to informal interaction among peers 
(Mitchell,1987). In academe, this network provides information exchange, 
collaboration, career planning,strategizing and assistance. It also provides 
professional and psychological support, and access to visiblity and upward 
mobility (Welch, 1980; Green, 1982). Research reveals that both male and female 
faculty members tend to include more colleagues/friends of the same gender in 
their informal networks. Since male faculty members constitute the majority, 
they have greater access to the oldboy network, they have greater access to the 
oldboy network, and benefit from information exchange. Whereas, famale faculty 
members are relatively disadvantaged in this regard (Lewis, 1975, Simeone, 
1987).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">2. Differential Performance Between Men and Women:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Differential 
performance between man and women can be attributed to three main sources: 1) 
different early socialization; 2) different educational background and training; 
and 3) different social and cultural constraints on career pursuit between man 
and women.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">1) 
Personal Choice:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Prior 
studies suggest that women's status in academe is more or less a matter of 
choice (Bernard, 1964; Johnson &amp; Stafford, 1979). Most women choose family life 
over career as their first priority, and reduce job participation during the 
child-rearing years. As a result, they tend to have a shorter career, a lower 
average productivity, and lower salaries compared to men (Johnson &amp; Stafford, 
1979).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">2) 
Different Educatioinal Background and Training:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Women 
are socialized to be more oriented to the teacher's than the scholar's role. 
Females are taught to be more concerned with socio-emotional (nurturing) aspects 
such as working with students rather than on research and publication (Bayer, 
1973; Finkelstelin, 1985b). Bernard (1964) calls this reward gap women's &quot;status 
channel inconsistency.&quot; That is, although there are many channels for upward 
mobility in academe, women tend to emphasize channels which are not highly 
valued and hard to justify, such as teaching or working with students rather 
than research and publication.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
addition, women appear to be less involved in off-campus professional or social 
activities (Bayer, 1973; Morlock, 1973; Cameron, 1978). This lack of outside 
campus professional and social participation results in women's lower rate of 
colleagueship, collaboration, and authorship. Moreover, with respect to 
paid-consulting, women academics are only two-thirds of the number of men who 
engage in such activities (Bayer, 1973).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">3) 
Different Social and Cultural Constraints Over Women's Career Pursuit:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Marriage 
and family obligations are considered two major constraints which influence 
women's pursuit of academic careers. Married female faculty members experience 
more role conflicts between work and family than male and unmarried female 
faculty (Herman &amp; Gyllstrom, 1977; Koester &amp; Clark, 1980). Many academic women 
complain about the tensions of time management. Studies show that female faculty 
members are found to spend 50 to 100% more time in home maintenance (Gappa, 
et.al., 1979), and 40% less time in academic work than their male counterparts 
(Herman &amp; Gyllstrom, 1977).</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">The Academic Reward System for Taiwan's University Faculty</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Total 
income is selected as the only indicator of academic reward in this study. 
Specifically, the remuneration for full-time university teachers is divided into 
two parts: salary and allowances. The former differs in accordance with 
positions, concurrent administrative work, and professional experience. The 
latter includes research, food, and housing allowances. In addition, a research 
subsidy fund has been set up under the National Science Council of the Executive 
Yuan for those who wish to conduct specific research projects.The pay scale for 
public university teachers is fixed according to the salary scale for public 
functionaries, and based on twelve-month employment (Lu, 1986; Ministry of 
Educaiton,1991). Each rank has at least ten different salary levels (see the 
Appendix). The higher the rank, the greater the difference between each point on 
the scale. For example, professors in the highest scale sometimes receive 3-4 
times as much as the incoming teaching assistants (Lin, 1987).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">It 
is believed that in addition to the fixed institutional salaries, outside income 
is also an imprtant indicator of academic rewards. Since Taiwan is actively 
recruiting experts and professionals, many faculty members are offered 
paidconsultations by outside business enterprises. It is very difficult to track 
down the amount of outside income since most people will not release this 
information. Nevertheless, the accumulation of institutional and outside income 
serves as the basis for this variable.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to a nation-wide survery on the appointment and compensation of the university 
and college faculty members in Taiwan (Lin, 1987), institutional income 
differences are found to be associated with type of institution, rank, higher 
level administration, degree, age, seniority, and gender.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Another 
field study on Taiwan's femals faculty (N=100) indicates that no discrimination 
was found among university teachers with respect to the formal academic structur, 
such as, employment, salary, and promotion (Hsu, 1988). However, subtle forms of 
gender discrimination do exist and continue to affect people in every work 
setting. In order to overcome gender's negative impact, female faculty need to 
excel by upgrading their personal qualifications through degress, research 
publications, and in-service training (Chang, 1988).</span></font></p>

professors in 1990.The total number of full and associate professors was 5,802.

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Since

number of males (N=827) were also selected from the same data-set by stratified 
sampling based on their institutions. The two waves of mailing to 1,654 faculty 
returned 740 valid questionnaires with a response rate of 45%. According to a 
conversation with Dr. Lin, the chairman from the Psychology Department at 
Chengchi University, who has also conducted many surverys among university 
faculty in Taiwan, the typical response rate is approximately 20%. An other 
national survey on university and colege faculty members aslo received a 
response rate of 42%</span>－<span lang="EN-US">or 32% valid survey response in

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">What 
factors predicted for a higher total income? The most significant predictors for 
both genders were: a higher rank (professor), a non-academic spouse, higher 
administrative positions, number of publications, shorter employment, employed 
in a public institution,not working alone, teaching less, and engaging in 
community service. After partialling out the effects of all other significant 
predictors, gender (female) entered the regression as negative predictor 
(t=-3.65, p&lt;.01). Gender which had a negative correlation with total income 
(r=-.32) had and added 2% in variation change after the effects of all other 
preceding variables were held constant.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Specifically, 
the common method of income determination in academe involved the use of salary 
levels within ranks. Even though the outside income comprised a certain 
proportion of the income differences in this study, rank served as a basis for 
the institutional salary. Both of them have been shown to be highly correlated (Folger, 
et. al., 1980;Astin &amp; Bayer, 1972 and 1979; Gordon, et. al., 1974; Astin and 
Snyder, 1982). As expected, the most significant predictor of income was the 
professor rank (beta=.38), which accounted for 22% of the variance in income 
(p&lt;.01) indicating that the higher the rank (professor), the higher the total 
income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">It 
is interesting to see that having a spouse who also worked in academe did not 
enhance one's income (beta=-.11). The results were quite opposite to Astin's 
findings which indicates that women faculty who marry an academic spouse will 
benefit from information exchange and networking; thus, they will have more 
access to resources for mobility and higher incomes (Astin &amp; Bayer, 1979). 
However, this was not the case in this study, in part because academic mobility 
was relatively rare compared to the United States. Both husband and wife as 
academics might be more interested in teaching and research rater than engaging 
in off-campus activities or administrative positions which would contribute to 
more monetary rewards. The other possibility was that within this double income 
family (spouse was also working as academic), one might be less motivated to 
work for extra money since both work full-time. However, this assumption could 
not be further justified given the lack of information about the working or 
non-working spouse.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
addition, being in a higher level administrative position enhanced one's 
income(r=.28, beta=.13). Because of the position, faculty members would not only 
get extra payment from the job, but also hasd access to decision making and more 
resources.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Prior 
studies have reported that research productivity is associated with 
salary(Carnegie Commission, 1973; Astin &amp; Bayer, 1979; Astin &amp; Snyder, 1982; 
Bouillon, 1987; Astin &amp; Snyder, 1992). However, in this study, the total number 
of books and articles were grouped to increase the variability of the sample 
since many subjects did not have any publications. In the analysis, the total 
number of books and articles was entered as a significant predictor of toal 
income (r=.32, beta=.10). It added 2% of the R-square change indicating that the 
higher the total number of publications, the higher the total income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
zero-correlation between years of experience (seniority) and total income is 
positive and moderate (r=.12). However, seniority entered the regression as a 
negative predictor in the regression equation (beta=-.11). In other words, 
higher seniority in academe did not necessarily result in higher income in 
Taiwan. Why is this the case? After exammining the regression table, the answer 
was quite obvious. seniority became negative(partial r=.10) once rank 
(professor) entered the regression equation. In other words, those who did not 
advance to the professor rank did worse in total income. Those people tend to be 
around for a long period of time, but never achieved the professor rank. This is 
probably the reason seniority entered as a negative predictor of income after 
the effect of rank was taken into consideration.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Furthermore, 
faculty members currently employed in a public institution tend to have a higher 
total income (beta=.10). Salarywise, faculty members both from public and 
private universities are supposed to have comparable institutional income. 
However, public universities in Taiwan are sponsored by the government. They are 
not only considered more prestigious but are also financially better-off. The 
private institutions, on the other hand, can rely only on their limited 
resources, such as tuition and private donations. Consequently, faculty from 
public institutions tend to have more oportunities and access to resources and 
extra income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
expected, the estblishment of networking was critical to information exchange 
and opportunities. In the analysis, working alone entered the regression as a 
negative predictor (beta=-.11). People who worked alone without any social 
network would have a lower income (r=-.12). On the other hand, working with 
colleagues rather than in isolation facilitated one's networking procedure; 
hence, it would empower one with more opportunities, including having a higher 
total income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
correlation between hours spent in teaching and total income was moderately 
negative (r=-.18). The more hours one spent on teaching per week, the less 
likely he/she would earn more. Nevertheless, though this variable entered into 
the regression equation, it did not contribute much to the variation change of 
the total R-square.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Engagement 
in community service (including paid-consultations) is a method of increasing 
one's income. Since engagement in community service entered as an important 
predictor (beta=.09), those who dealt with community service were more likely to 
have a higher income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">One 
of the major purposes of this study is to examine whether gender differences 
continue to exist after the impact of other variables are partialled out. In the 
analysis, gender entered the regression with a negative coefficient (beta=-.14) 
and contributed a 2% variation change to total income after all other 
independent varables to total income after all the other independent variables 
were held constant. Since female was codified as 1 and male as 0, females, as 
hypothesized earlier, tend to have a lower total income than their male 
counterparts after controlling for the effects of variables such as academic 
rank, spousal occupation, supervisory administrative position and so forth.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
the analysis above, time spent in household duties was not included because it 
was highly correlated with gender (r=.52). It is reasonable to say that women 
spent more time in domestic work. In another analysis, time spect in household 
duties was included and entered the regression equation as a significant 
predictor (beta=-.13, t=-3.5, p&lt;.01). However, once gender was entered in the 
regression analysis, the effect of hours of household duties no longer reached 
significance (t=-1.28, t&gt;.05). As a matter of fact, for both genders, the income 
trade-off existed between fulfilling domestic obligations and academic 
engagement. Above all, being a woman was a more signifficant variable at 
predicting a lower income. There is no doubt that gender's effect would take off 
and suppress the household influence on income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">It 
is interesting that variables such as a doctoral degree and natural sciences did 
not make significant additional contributions in the regression equations 
because the correlations of both variables were very minimal (r=.09 and .11 
respectively).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
summary, the results indicate that those who were in a higher academic 
rank,assumed higher level administrative positions, published more books and 
articles, worked in a public institution, or engaged in community service were 
more likely to have a higher total income. On the other hand, those who married 
an academic spouse, stayed longer in academe, worked alone, or taught more would 
have a lower total income. Above all, female faculty members had a lower total 
income than their male coounterparts even after demographic, educational, and 
work variables were taken into consideration.The hypothesis then was supported 
and gender differences in total income still prevailed in Taiwan's academic 
reward system.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Since 
gender differences in total income have been confirmed, it is worth 
investigating how women differ from their male counterparts. In other words, 
what variable predicts income within each population (men and women). Two 
stepwise multiple regression analyses were carried out separately for each sex 
as follows. The same set of independent variables as in the preceding analysis 
plus hours in househould duties excluding gender were entered in the analysis 
(see Table 3).</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
predicting one's total income, a final R-square of .22 for males and .24 for 
females was obtained. In order to earn a higher salary, certain characteristics 
were critical for males as well as for females (see Table 3). A higher rank, 
community service, and publications were all significant variables for both 
genders.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Working 
alone without a social network affected men's income negatively (beta=-.20). In 
other words, working with colleagues rather than indivadual engagement on 
research was very crucial for men. Men were more likely to broaden their social 
network and to increase their income through team work.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
fact that hours spent on teaching and household duties entered the analysis for 
man but not for women had some interesting implications. In other words, these 
two variables had less variability within the female sample than the male one. 
Men received more negative impacts from taking on more teaching and household 
responsibilities. It appears that women's engagement in thses two activites were 
usually taken for granted and the impact was not as easily visible. Furthermore, 
women, on the average, spent more time in teaching (19 hours) and house work (18 
hours) compard to men (15 and 7 hours respectively) per week. Since most men 
engaged less in these two activities, those who were more involved would become 
more visible. These male faculty might be more concerned for their family and 
students, and less ambitious in making money. Or they might feel sufficient in 
family income since their wife was also working (as an academic). Above all, the 
trade-off for these men was that they had less time for research, 
administration, and other community services; as a consequence, they earned 
less.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">For 
men, the variable, years of experience (seniority), entered as a negative 
predictor of income (beta=-.22). For them, the longer employment in academe did 
not necessarily render a higher income. Again, seniority became negative 
(partial r=-.15) only after rank(professor) entered the regression equation. 
Those men who stayed for a longer time in the current level were less likely to 
advance to the professor rank and did worse in total income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Publication 
of books and articles contributed 3% of the variation change; it indicates that 
research productivity was very important to facilitate men's total income. 
Engaging in community service, on the other hand, entered the regression 
equation with a minimal influence on the R-square change.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Finally, 
there was moderate correltion between women's income and their administrative 
positions (r=.18), though this variable did not enter the equation as a 
significant predictor.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
summary, it was more likely for both genders to obtain a higher salary through a 
higher academic rank, higher number of publication records, and by engaging in 
community service. Participating in team work rather than individual dedication 
to research was essential for men to enhance social networking and income. In 
general women tend to work on their own and remained isolated from the &quot;old-boy 
netwok.&quot; Above all, family obligations affected both men's and women's income to 
some extent, but the impact on men was far more visible.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Interviews</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to the interviews, gender differences are found to exist in Taiwan's academic 
reward system within which institutional salary is fixed and the equal 
opportunity for employment and promotion is regulated by the government. The 
reward system itself seems to be fair and objective; however, in practice, 
different attitudes toward men and women derived from cultural constraints have 
rooted in people's mind and distorted the fair implementation of the system. 
This is how women's careers in academe are affected by subtle gender 
discrimination. Another point is that women's lives are very much shaped by 
forces from different directions, the family influence in particular. In this 
regard, the present study seems to confirm the existing Western theories which 
account for such gender differences in academe from overt discrimination (as a 
result of gender) and different performance (as a result of life priority) 
between men and women.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
the interviews indicated, men and women actually experience differential 
treatments in academe which supports the survey finding. In addition to the 
gender factor, marriage is considered to facilitate men's academic caree, while 
inhibiting women's achievement in academe.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
interviews further explained why men tend to have better opportunities than 
women of comparable qualifications in this profession because: 1) as cultural 
constraints in history, men entered academe first and became the dominant group; 
2) gender stereotypes prevail and continue in the real job setting; 3) the lack 
of comparable worth provides men with more legitimate opportunities for rewards; 
4) women are less aggressive and confined by social roles dur to different 
socialization; 5) as a minority group, women are more likely to be excluded from 
the social network; 6) men and women have different life priorities, career for 
men and family responsibility for women; 7) the academic structure is euqal in 
its written forms except for its short of constructive guidelines and valid 
feedbacks; and 8) personal decision affects individual career development.
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Based 
on the preceding findings, men in general are found to be less sensitive to 
gender differences in academe and experinece no inequality in rewards. They seem 
to believe that the system is equal and gender-free. On the other hand, women 
are not united in their opinions; some criticize the male-dominant culture; 
others attribute the gender inequality in the academic world to personal choice. 
It is natural that these diverse comments are based on personal experience and 
deserve interprettion with caution. In summary, the academic reward structure is 
fair in its written rules; however, in reality, women generally experience 
inequality due to various reasons.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Conclusions</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
current study suggested that many questions remained to be answered. According 
to the study, male and female faculty members in Taiwan were rewarded 
differently in their total income. Men and women differed from each other with 
respect to background characteristics. People may argue that male and female 
faculty members were not rewarded the same as a result of the preceding 
differential. However, after controlling for individual factors which affect 
salaries (such as rank, administration, publication, seniority, type of 
institution, and working alone), it is possible to predict that being a woman 
means a lower total income.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Some 
research studies argue that the salary differentials can be explained in part by 
women's shorter time on the professional ladder (Chang, 1988). However, 
according to the study, there is no significuant difference between men and 
women in terms of their seniority though women are two years younger than men on 
the average. Others may argue that the gender differentials are a result of 
fewer female doctorates (Astin, 1979). In this study, women faculty were found 
to have fewer doctorates than their male counterparts, and yet when the impact 
of the doctoral degree in partiales out in the multiple regression analyses, 
women are still less rewarded in salary. Thus, seniority and the highest degree 
(doctorate) seem to be less the issue in explaining why men and women are 
rewarded differently in the study. In addition, one may argue that the reason 
women on the average have a lower income is because they are in the lower rank. 
However, after the effect of rank is eliminated in the analysis, female faculty 
still earn less than their male counterparts.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
the interview results suggest, men tend to have more access to higher 
administrative positions, to community services (though this was not confirmed 
by statistical data), and to social networks. Consequently, unlike the women, 
men are more visible in the field,receive more recognition and allowances from 
institutions, and have more presence in the decision-making process.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">However, 
many interviewees in the study were reluctant to admit that the gender 
differentials are a result of sex discrimination in academe. Is this because as 
high achievers and successful applicants, these faculty members were less likely 
to experience any discrimination; or because it was too sensitive for them to 
relate to any forms of discrimination since many of them were in administrative 
positions? The answer is unknown.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Whether 
or not there is gender discrimination in Taiwan's academic reward system is 
still a question to be answered. Nevertheless, the fact that women, on the 
average, earn less is obvious. One thing that deserves attention is that the 
variable, total income, in the study represents the accumulative ammount of 
salaries from institution and outside sources. Since the latter constitute a 
certain proportion of one's income (unfortunately the percentge varies and 
remaines unknown) as a result of individual activities beyond institution, it is 
difficult to draw andy conclusion on the inequality of income rewards within the 
system. Despite this according to the interviews, it is fair to conclude that 
gender differentials in the academic reward system are attributable to the 
general social context due to the following phenomena: the uneven distribution 
of resources and opportunities between the majority and minority groups in 
academe, the different social expectations and cultural constraints between men 
and women, and personal decisions and preferences for life priorities.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
current study examines daily teaching activities among junior high school 
teachers in Taiwan. The purpose is to investigate how teachers conduct their 
instruction and related activities in and outside the classroom, and the 
possible reasons behind their strategies. Classroom observations of 126 hours 
and interviews with 47 teachers from junior high schools were used for data 
collection. The findings are as follows:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">1) As a result of the prevailing attitude of acquiring 
credentials in Taiwan, school teaching has been dominated by ways of cramming 
and indoctrination in secondary schools. Preparation for high school entrance 
exams has become the first priority of school teaching at the expense of 
cultivation for students' well-balanced development.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">2) A teacher's daily schedule in junior high schools is 
usually very busy. Teachers' weekly classroom teaching hours are relatively 
short, but they have many other duties to fulfill during the entire school day.&nbsp; 
In the study, 80% of the teachers stayed at school over eight hours per day, 
working from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM.&nbsp; In addition to the required classroom 
instruction, 82% of them conduct a two-hour supplementary teaching after school 
every week.&nbsp; Seventy percent teach in a class of over forty students.&nbsp; Though 
the classroom teachers are released from a few hours of instruction, they are 
responsible for student counseling and classroom management.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">3) With regard to the classroom instruction, it is found to 
be very teacher-oriented and teacher-centered. Most of the instructions are 
related to content development and tests.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">4) Teachers' daily routines on correcting papers and grading 
examinations are very demanding after classroom instruction.&nbsp; The trade-off is 
that teachers become less likely to engage in class preparation and activities 
for professional growth.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">5) Most teachers express their difficulty is in dealing with 
a class of diverse student learning backgrounds, especially under the current 
centralized educational policy, and obsession for acceptance to a good high 
school.&nbsp; Although class tracking is forbidden by the educational authority, in 
reality, this grouping system has come to exist in many campuses.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">6) Teachers take on various roles beyond teaching.&nbsp; Classroom 
teachers, in particular, assume heavy student guidance duties.&nbsp; Dealing with 
student grades and behavioral problems have become the teachers' priority. The 
latter, for many teachers, is even more challenging than classroom instruction.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Introduction</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Compulsory 
education has been extended to junior high school since 1968 in Taiwan.&nbsp; From 
that time, students receive a public education up to the ninth grade based on 
their residential district regardless of their different social and academic 
backgrounds. The instructions in junior high schools are guided by detailed 
national standards of a fixed curriculum.&nbsp; Across the entire island, students of 
the same grade are expected to learn the same materials in the same time frames 
with the help of the same textbook.&nbsp; The pace is undoubtedly too high or too low 
for some individuals, but the strict rule of national standardization works to 
systematically preserve a general level of equal opportunity in compulsory 
education (Rohlen, 1983).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
for teachers in junior high schools, classroom instruction is profoundly 
influenced by the required textbooks.&nbsp; Textbooks are the key vehicle for the 
presentation of the statements and the bulk of the information.&nbsp; Thus, examples 
of instructional independence of textbooks are rare, because the great majority 
teachers design their lectures with only entrance examinations in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
teacher's major job is to supplement and clarify the basic knowledge, keeping 
pace with the textbook in their lectures.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Because 
of the prevailing attitudes among junior high school students toward passing the 
exam for a good high school, which then will lead to access to the university, 
instruction has become a process of testing rather than providing a well-rounded 
education. As a result, students in the second or third year of junior high 
schools come to view their teachers merely as people whose job is to evaluate 
them by numerous exams rather than persons to help them grow and fulfill 
themselves.&nbsp; In the course of instruction, since the crucial force is to prepare 
for the entrance exam, teachers are required to disseminate information to 
students. Students are also expected to absorb the information for exams and 
remain passive in the classroom.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
a result of the great emphasis on examinations, educational problems, especially 
in the junior high school, have been brought to the attention of society during 
the last few years.&nbsp; Educational issues are discussed and debated over and over 
again, such as class tracking, the excessive use of study aids and exam papers, 
the endless practice exams, student discipline problems, and the increase of 
juvenile delinquency.&nbsp; In other words, preparation for high school entrance 
exams has become the only priority of school teaching which sacrifices students' 
mental and physical development.&nbsp; The debates over what causes the preceding 
problems in junior high schools have continued, especially in the era of 
Taiwan's education reform (Wang &amp; Wang, 1994).</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">The examination culture and student problem</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
Chinese examination system left its mark by maintaining a renewed form in the 
contemporary society of Taiwan.&nbsp; This tradition reinforces the value of 
scholarship and credentials as the preferred route to success.&nbsp; As Miyazaki 
discarded in his book entitled &quot;China's Examination Hell&quot; (1981), the impact of 
examination has been embedded in Chinese culture since ancient times.&nbsp; For 
example, studies show that the system of entrance examinations for high school 
exerts a pervasive influence over the whole nature of school environment (Hsieh, 
1988; Tzeng, 1994).&nbsp; Classroom instruction has become the vehicle of passing 
high school entrance examinations, which then will lead to a better career path 
(Wang &amp; Wang, 1994).&nbsp; In this competitive school environment, achievement on 
tests is more valued than learning.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">As 
a result, many students become at risk if they perform poorly in the race of 
academic competition.&nbsp; For example, some of them sooner or later develop an 
inferiority complex,&nbsp; a severe sense of depression and failure (Mochizuki, 
1990).&nbsp; Others' reaction is a sense of resentment and hostility toward teachers 
and school.&nbsp; For example, student discipline problems have been increasing 
recently and can be attributed to teacher ignorance of individual differences, 
student alienating experiences in the class, and the text-oriented lecture 
format of instruction which has much less utility for students who are not going 
to high school.&nbsp; The confusion and frustration increase with time, as do student 
problems. Moreover, the recent increasing problems of violence against teachers 
and schools is partly due to a much larger phenomenon derived from the process 
of academic competition (Juang, 1984).</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Despite 
the controversy taking place in secondary education, very few studies have been 
conducted on school sites, let alone any sophisticated or in-depth classroom 
observations.&nbsp; Without first-hand data, it is impossible to identify underlying 
causes for the instructional problems in junior high schools.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to G.&nbsp; Spindle (Hsieh, 1988), classroom instruction is often regarded as a 
&quot;black box,&quot; whose process is rarely known to the outside world.&nbsp; Only by the 
channel of school ethnography researchers can further access to the knowledge of 
teachers' daily life as well as their instructional strategy in the class.&nbsp; 
Through the comprehension of social context, (such as language and culture) and 
the instrument of observation or survey, one can conduct a longitudinal study on 
target subjects.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
researchers should remain neutral and objective when they administer 
interviews.&nbsp; In other words, ethnography of schooling is a method to first 
collect detailed information and the insider's viewpoint through a natural 
process.&nbsp; After transcribing and decoding the data, researchers will develop 
their study framework and research tools from an outsiders' perspective.&nbsp; 
Through classroom observation, interview, or survey, one can verify results with 
the original proposition.&nbsp; It is also a good way to discover hidden agendas in 
classroom activities (Good, 1982; Rag, 1995).</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Time Use and Activities in Junior High Classes</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Studies 
of class time use have been conducted in many ways, including individual student 
time on task, minutes and hours of instruction, classroom organization and 
allocation of time.&nbsp; Among the measures of time studies, time allocated to 
instruction has been shown to be significant and positively related to 
achievement </span>　<span lang="EN-US">(Borg, 1980; Sanford, 1982).&nbsp; The reason 
is that time allocation of different activities can be controlled directly by 
the teacher.&nbsp; Class time spent in different activities is a variable that 
teachers themselves can assess and manipulate in planning for instruction.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Flanders 
(Kuo, 1985) points out that the teaching process can be described by the 
&quot;Principle of Two thirds. &quot;&nbsp; Specifically, in the average teaching activity, 
teachers are encouraged to converse with students two thirds of their class 
time.&nbsp; During the preceding conversation, teachers are advised to conduct two 
thirds of the time in lecturing.&nbsp; In the course of lectures, two thirds of it 
falls into the category of direct languages, including developing content, 
giving orders, and managing student discipline problems.&nbsp; The remaining time 
should be open to all students for comments and feedback, including any other 
forms of indirect dialogues.&nbsp; Other studies also indicate an effective teacher 
is the one who spends less time in direct language, and more time in two way 
communications with students (Hsu, 1982; Sun, 1985). Class discussion, in this 
respect, is considered an important strategy to stimulate students to become 
attentive, intelligent, critical and expressive (Ker, 1995; Garden, 1982a; 
Garden, 1982b).</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">Tracking</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
Taiwan, many junior high school teachers feel frustrated in teaching a regular 
class due to the striking difference between students' learning motivation and 
abilities.&nbsp; Therefore, the tracking system exists on many campuses and provides 
a solution to the preceding problem in Taiwan.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to Oakes (1985), tracking is the process whereby students are divided into 
categories so that they can be assigned in groups to various kinds of classes. 
The most common way in Taiwan is to classify students as academic or vocational 
oriented.&nbsp; Students, consequently, are placed into so called &quot;good&quot; or &quot;average&quot; 
classes on the basis of their grades or scores on ability tests.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Apparently, 
there are several reasons why tracking is welcome and exists widely though it is 
officially forbidden by the government.&nbsp; Many teachers and parents argue that 
students learn better when they are grouped with others at the same level of 
academic performance; the placement process for tracking can accurately and 
fairly reflect past achievements and native abilities of students; and it is 
much easier for teachers to accommodate individual differences in homogeneous 
groups (Oakes, 1982; Chiou, 1995).&nbsp; However, a vast majority of research on 
tracking comes to the same conclusion: no group of students has been found to 
benefit consistently from being in a homogeneous group.&nbsp; Students placed in 
average and low track classes do not develop positive attitudes later on.&nbsp; 
Instead, this arrangement usually impairs students' self esteem among their peer 
group.&nbsp; In addition, low track students have been found to participate less in 
extracurricular activities at school, to misbehave more, and to get involved 
more often in delinquent behavior off campus.&nbsp; Taiwan's junior high schools also 
have encountered the preceding consequences of tracking and are struggling to 
come to terms with this dilemma.</span></font></p>

analysis, research instrument, and so forth were made by the researcher and a 
liason teacher at the school working in collaboration.&nbsp; Data in this study were 
collected through classroom observation and in depth interviews. Twenty college 
students were trained to conduct classroom observations and interviews.&nbsp; 
Thereafter, each of them conducted a two-day observation on an individual 
teacher's in-and outside-classroom activities during a regular school day (from 
8:00 AM to 4:30 PM) in the spring of 1995.&nbsp; After classroom observations, an

<span lang="EN-US">1) Teaching load:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">With 
regard to the daily schedule of junior high schools in Taiwan, schools begin and 
end at set hours.&nbsp; Classes and activities are fixed by the daily schedule.&nbsp; For 
example, most students and classroom teachers will arrive at school before 7:30 
for morning self-study practice. Classes formally begin around 8:10, six 
mornings a week, and last until 4:30 in the afternoon, Monday through Friday, 
and till 12:00 noon on Saturdays. Another fifty-minute supplementary class will 
be held usually sfter 4:30 PM. A brief ten-minute break is allowed between each 
class. Seven periods of fifty minutes each follow, with a seventy- to ninety- 
minute lunch break at noon.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Class 
instruction organized by grade level and subject is conducted by a classroom 
teacher and teachers of different specialized subjects. The Taiwanese homeroom 
system with a single classroom teacher, the same classmates, and a common room, 
remains a family system in school. The system operates in way very similar to 
the Japanese school system (Shields, 1990)</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">2) Class time use in different activities:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to our observation of 126 hours, each classroom instruction lasts 50.41 minutes 
on the average (the maximum 62 minutes, the minimum 40 minutes), longer than the 
50 minutes officially required for each individual class (see Table 1). Among 
different activities, teachers' presentation of curriculum content comprises the 
greatest majority of 28.56 minutes (57%); time for examination practice 5.30 
minutes (10%); student seatwork and transitions 3.98 minutes separately (8%); 
administrative and procedural routines 3.40 minutes (7%); pairs or small group 
activities 1.65 minutes (3%); discipline 1.57 minutes (3%); free talk 1.4 
minutes (3%); and the remaining time for leisure time and others (less than a 
minute).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
other words, teachers spend 67% of their regular class time on content 
development and examination practice; 21% on non-academic activities, such as 
procedural routines, transition, discipline, and free talk; and only 11% student 
seatwork and small group discussion. Most class time is led by teachers 
(teacheroriented instruction and tests).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">3) Instructional method:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to observation and interview, the most frequent teaching method is found to be 
lecture. The reasons for this are various: lecture is more time-consuming; there 
is too much content to cover in a limited time; the class size is also too large 
to conduct individualized learning; and it is most efficient to fulfill the need 
for test preparation. The prevailing attitudes among junior high school students 
and their parents toward preparation for high school entrance exam have 
pressured teachers' attitude toward instruction. As a result, teachers 
compromise and adopt lecturing as the most, if not the only, convenient way to 
fulfill the requirement of preparing students to pass the entrance examination. 
On very rare occasions, group discussion takes place in the classroom. 
Question-and-answer is also seen in the teaching process; however, it has 
nothing to do with the practice of creative/critical thinking skills. Most of 
the time, students are asked to stand to answer when the answer is obvious in 
the textbook. It is hardly the way to induce open discussions. Instruction 
almost completely dominated by lecture is a thoroughly established pattern.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">4) Problems encountered during the teaching process:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
the question of &quot;The major problem confronted in your instruction...&quot;, most 
teachers expressed their trouble in dealing with a class of diverse student 
learning backgrounds, especially under pressure of the current centralized 
educational policy and focus on the high school entrance examination.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Specifically, 
most teachers admit that teaching in a class of very diverse student learning 
backgrounds is most challenging. Although compulsory education is characterized 
as recruiting students from different backgrounds and abilities, teachers 
complain about this problem quite often. Because junior high schools in Taiwan 
are guided by detailed national standards of a rigid curriculum requirement, 
students of the same grade are supposed to learn the same content nationwide. 
The curriculum is certainly too difficult or too easy for some individuals. In a 
regular class of more than 40 students, teachers feel limited in meeting the 
needs of every individual student. In addition, most teachers are asked to 
improve their students' test score in order to prepare students for the &quot;major 
examination&quot; of high schools. The over-emphasis on grades and tests has 
distorted the goal of instruction.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
solving the preceding problem, many teachers express their support, though not 
openly, for class tracking. Only one-fifth of teachers are in favor of the 
regular class arrangement officially required by the government. The remaining 
support tracking of any form. According to the study, the possible reasons 
behind this skewed attitude are as follows:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">(1) 
The over-crowded class size makes classroom teaching almost impossible to meet 
the needs of individual differences; in addition, the size of the classroom is 
also too small to conduct any different ways of instruction.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">(2) 
The use of pencil-paper tests for each subject instead of other alternative ways 
of evaluation has constrained the scope of student achievement, let alone 
fulfilled the dimensions of education (moral education, intellectual 
development, athletics, team work, and aesthetics). Those who perform poorly on 
tests will feel most frustrated, and probably give up learning later on.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">(3) 
Teachers do not have enough training in dealing with students of heterogeneous 
learning backgrounds. Therefore, most teachers have difficulties in making 
instruction fulfilling and interesting. For some students, the instruction pace 
is hard to keep up with or not challenging enough. But the emphasis of the 
strict rule of same textbooks and examinations has limited options of teachers 
and students.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">(4) 
Teachers are under a great pressure in preparing students for passing high 
school entrance exams. Passing exams have become the sole educational priority 
in teaching process. The severe grade competition usually forces teachers to 
give up students at risk academically; the latter often, in return, become the 
source of discipline problem in classroom management.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">5) Opinions about textbooks, school aids, and practice tests:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
major textbook problem that most teachers are confronted with is the centralized 
policy toward a fixed set of textbooks. In other words, teachers are required to 
complete the same materials in the same time frames with the same textbook. They 
do not have any other choice to design their own instruction for individual 
differences. Although teachers, on average, complain about the lack of 
flexibility in using textbooks, more and more have become insensitive and care 
less about this problem after years of teaching. Many of them also have begun to 
accept the reality and have persuaded themselves to regard instruction as merely 
a daily routine. The only thing they can do is to teach accordingly. As a 
result, the vast majority of teachers do not challenge the authority of the 
textbook. Except for the new teachers, they do not have to spend much time on 
class preparation or curriculum design. In addition, what matters more is the 
demand for test practice. For example, it is typical for teachers to administer 
exams after each class. In this respect, the whole teaching process is full of 
detailed knowledge and repetition of book content. Active student active 
learning and participation in any debate are absent in most classes.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Another 
critique comes from the lack of usefulness of the textbook. There is a big gap 
between real life and what they learn in the classroom. It is difficult to 
persuade students to combine what they are learning from school with what they 
are encountering in real life. If not for preparing for the entrance exams, the 
lack of connection between book knowledge and daily life would make instruction 
completely boring and dull.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
other issue is also worthwhile to remember. The widespread use of practice 
tests, review of books, and study aids is nothing new at secondary school. All 
these commercially sold supplementary materials rely on the basic official 
textbook. The business is accelerated by the emphasis on entrance exam 
preparation.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">6) The ten-minute break:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
most frequent activities that teachers engage in include: dealing with student 
problems; going to the restroom; drinking water and taking a break; preparing 
for the next class instruction; grading papers and exams; and contacting 
parents. During the break, classroom teachers usually spend most of their time 
meeting students. It is also worth noting that very few teachers are found to be 
punctual to begin or close their classroom instruction. Reasons are various, 
including completing materials in a limited time frame; managing unexpected 
student emergencies in the classroom; giving tests, and so on.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">7) Challenge of the work:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
most stressful experiences that teachers have from work are in the following 
order: 1) dealing with student discipline problem; 2) teaching-related errands; 
3) parent-teacher communications; 4) advising students participating in 
contests; and 5) substitute teaching or after class instruction. In other words, 
dealing with student problems, including contacting parents and helping with 
student contests, comprises the first priority in teachers' daily life at 
school. This is especially the case among classroom teachers who are responsible 
for a homeroom class. Devoting time and effort to teaching improvement becomes 
less urgent compared with handling student problems. In the course of classroom 
observation, a few teachers are frustrated and exhausted in getting ready for 
solving any possible emergencies that might come up among students. 
Consequently, teachers are under a great deal of psychological pressure after 
confronting a wide range of student problems from a large class size.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">8) Time use outside classroom:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">According 
to observation, most teachers will return to their teachers' room after class, 
where each teacher has a desk. The teachers' room is used in various ways, such 
as meeting students, preparation and evaluation work for teaching, individual 
study, and drinking tea or coffee. It is a typical example of Taiwan's 
collectivist culture described by some western scholars (Hofstede, 1980).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">From 
the study, every teacher, on average, has 283.95 minutes after classroom 
instruction (excluding the noon break) (see Table 2). Grading exams and 
correcting papers make up 86.14 minute (30.3%), dealing with students 36.91 
minutes (13%), instructional preparation 31.03 minutes (11%), administrative 
duties 19.35 minutes (6,8%), advanced study 3.7 minutes (1.3%), and the 
remaining time for other unspecified activities. In other words, teachers are 
found to grade homework and exams mostly, followed by dealing with student 
problems, preparing instructional materials and instruments, handling 
administrative duties, and studying individually to upgrade their skills and 
knowledge.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Parents, 
like many other countries, usually participate in school activities through the 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to convey their concerns about school. However, 
in Taiwan, parental indirect involvement in the course of teaching through 
administrative channel bothers teachers very often. Specifically, teachers are 
often asked by the school authority (usually the principal) to improve their 
students' test score. In many cases, the request and pressure comes from the 
students' parents. Another problem comes from parents who have asked teachers to 
employ more rigid discipline in the classroom, and to be tougher with their 
children. In addition, teachers are sometimes asked to transfer to a different 
class in order to fulfill some special needs. Teachers' professional autonomy, 
in this regard, is often challenged by school authorities and parents. A serious 
interference of teaching methods and outcomes is not uncommon at school.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="標楷體">
<span lang="EN-US">Conclusion</span></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">The 
teaching profession in Taiwan is considered a secure and highly respected job, 
which attracts many talented individuals every year. Because learning and the 
ensuing academic credentials are most valued pursuits and goals in junior high 
schools, teachers are still greatly respected. According to the current study, a 
teacher's day in junior high schools is usually very crowded. Teachers' weekly 
classroom teaching hours are relatively short, about sixteen&nbsp; hours for 
classroom teachers and twenty-two hours for subject teachers, compared to 
fifteen hours per week in Japan and twenty-five hours in the United States. 
Nevertheless, they have many other duties to fulfill during the entire school 
day. In the study, 80% of the teachers stayed at school over eight hours per 
day, working from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM. In addition to the required classroom 
instruction, 82% of them conduct a two-hour supplementary teaching after school 
every week. Seventy percent teach in a class of over forty students. Though the 
classroom teachers are released from a few hours of instruction, they are 
responsible for student counseling and classroom management.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">With 
regard to classroom instruction, it is found to be very teacher-oriented and 
teacher-centered. Most of the instructions are related to content development 
and tests. Keeping up with textbooks and conducting examination practice leave 
little time for classroom discussion. Discussion or debate is considered 
inefficient and seldom held since information feeding is the major goal of 
instruction. Other factors, such as large class size, and profound reluctance by 
most students to express their opinions before a group also inhibit class 
discussion. It seems to be that most students would rather listen passively than 
participate actively in the course of instruction. On the other hand, the lack 
of individual learning and creative thinking in the class has made instruction 
less interesting and attractive to the students. Under these circumstances, 
teachers are less likely to conduct individualized learning, small group 
discussion, or any opportunity for two-way communication in the class (Ker, 
1995).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">During 
the ten-minute breaks, most teachers are observed drinking water, taking a 
break, going to the restroom, or dealing with student problems. The last 
activity is often seen among the classroom teachers. After instruction, most 
teachers will return to their offices, where teachers are found to be busy with 
paper and homework grading. This finding coincides with other research which 
indicate most primary and secondary teachers are found to correct papers and 
grade examinations in their office (Chen, 1988; Tseng, 1994). In other words, 
daily routines of correcting and grading are very demanding for teachers after 
classroom instruction. The trade-off is that teachers become less likely to 
engage in class preparation and professional growth, such as researching 
curriculum, attending seminars and joining study group.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Although 
the study does not intend to generalize the findings of the research, the author 
attempts to explore some reasons behind the current teaching activities in 
junior high schools. Reasons are manifold.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Firstly, 
according to the interview, teachers have mixed feelings about using lectures in 
the class. The positive side of the story is that, according to several 
interviewees, lectures are regarded as more efficient in content development, 
especially under the pressure of preparation for the high school entrance 
examinations. The downside of this instructional method derives from the 
over-emphasis on examination at the expense of students' active learning 
attitudes and sense of creativity. In addition, teachers also lack training in 
oral communication to help stimulate students' critical and creative thinking. 
Another reason is that teachers, after a few years of teaching, get used to 
lecturing on the textbook. It is also much easier to stay with textbooks for the 
sake of preparation for high school entrance examinations (Tsen, 1994).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Secondly, 
diverse student learning backgrounds makes teaching difficult. Most teachers 
from junior high schools work hard to overcome such diverse individual 
differences in learning. Class tracking is forbidden by the educational 
authority. However, in reality, this placement system has come to exist in many 
campuses, if not officially, in responding to the call from teachers parents as 
well. Student labeling is the by-product of class tracking, which groups 
students into different academic levels and provides different treatments in 
class. In spite of the controversial tracking problem, many teachers in the 
study support the notion of class tracking.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">Thirdly, 
teachers share in various roles beyond teaching. Classroom teachers, in 
particular, assume heavy student guidance duties. The study indicates that most 
teachers work more than eight hours at school. Although classroom teaching is 
the major responsibility, other activities outside classroom, such as grading, 
student counseling, parental contact, and many other school related duties are 
also very demanding. Consequently, many teachers work for a couple of hours in 
their schools after their official responsibilities are over. In other words, 
dealing with student grades and behavioral problems have become teachers' 
priority. The latter, in the eyes of many teachers, is even more challenging 
than teaching itself. In this regard, unfortunately, many teachers are not well 
prepared in updating their professional skills in dealing with discipline 
problems, which have become more and more complex as a result of Taiwan's 
drastic changes in society, family structure, and many other respects.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="標楷體">　　<span lang="EN-US">In 
sum, Stevenson (1990) once commented on teachers in Taiwan as more likely to 
summon energy for teaching in large classes because they instruct fewer hours 
than do their American counterparts. It is also believed that teachers in Taiwan 
have more time available during the day for preparing lessons, working with 
individual students, and conducting other class-related activities outside the 
classroom. Nevertheless, as a result of the prevailing emphasis on academic 
credentials in Taiwan, school teaching has been dominated by cramming and 
indoctrination in secondary schools. Preparation for high school entrance exams 
has become the first priority of school teaching at the expense of cultivating 
students' well-balanced development in the learning process. The current study 
demonstrates the fact that teachers in Taiwan are subject to a range of 
conflicting pressures from school authorities, peers, parents, and students. 
Meanwhile, the job of teaching itself is in flux as teachers explore a variety 
of identities and roles. They also find themselves often at the center of 
debates on school reform, and criticized by different interest groups from 
society. Will they stand up to challenge the prevailing attitude toward 
examination which has distorted educational goals and school instruction? How do 
they cope with the sense of frustration for not being able to meet the needs of 
individual differences in a large class? How do classroom teachers manage to 
combine the heavy duties of student guidance, other school business, and 
instructional improvement? Will junior high school teachers take part in school 
reform or stay out of it? Finally, will they continue to compromise with the 
examination culture? Many answers are yet to be explored.</span></font></p>
