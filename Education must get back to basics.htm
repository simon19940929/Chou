&nbsp; </font></font><font face="Batang" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR A LONG TIME 
Taiwan's education has had to give way to economic and political concerns and 
the voices of students and teachers have been drowned out by electoral fervor. 
In particular, the conflict between the Ministry of Education and the Taipei 
City Government over the removal of the inscription dazhong zhizheng (</font></span><font face="Batang"><font size="4">大中至正</font><span lang="EN-US"><font size="4">) 
on the gate leading to the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall received a 
great deal of media attention. It is regretful that officials traded accusations 
and resorted to offensive language over something that could have been resolved 
through rational communication.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development announced that 15-year-old Taiwanese high school students 
participating in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scored 
first in mathematics and fourth in science. However, the Progress in 
International Reading Literacy Study 2006 by the International Association for 
the Evaluation of Educational Achievement showed that Taiwanese students' 
reading performance was quite unsatisfactory and that many elementary and 
junior-high school students don't read extracurricular books.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This important piece of news was unfortunately almost ignored 
because of the heated debate over the removal of the inscription. Hong Kong, 
Japan and Macau readily responded to the results by drawing up new policies to 
improve their educational systems. In contrast, Taiwan's education officials 
hailed the test results as a reflection of the success of the nation's 
educational reform, but failed to provide the statistics to back up their 
claims, such as telling the general public why students perform well in 
mathematics and science, if there are any gender-related differences or 
differences between urban and rural<br>
areas or if the educational background of parents have an effect. They also 
failed to explain why the results were so good when many students don't like 
math or science classes, or why so many students don't like to read.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The government should end conflict and return to educational 
fundamentals. Only then can the necessary attention and priority be given to 
problems such as the fact that more than 100 elementary and junior-high schools 
do not have access to running water and students missed school because bus 
operations in the south were suspended.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We also hope the government will accomplish five things:</font></span></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
<span lang="EN-US"><font size="4" face="Batang">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, review 
the 10-year educational reform in order to improve educational quality. The 
government should use the results in these international competitions to review 
educational reform over the past dozen years. The review should place equal 
importance on educational quality and efficacy. It should also work to achieve 
fairness and justness, implement regular evaluations and base educational reform 
on objective and quantifiable information.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government should also strengthen the scientific system 
for educational statistics, make it available online and improve studies of 
these statistics, all in a bilingual Chinese and English format to enhance 
information transparency.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, given Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, non-governmental and 
governmental organizations should take the initiative to provide educational 
information to major international organizations and participate in 
international educational assessments to help<br>
strengthen Taiwan's integration into the international community and provide 
further benchmarks for national competitiveness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a review of educational policies that have been frequently 
criticized in recent years is urgently needed, including the increased burden on 
students resulting from the policy of providing several different books for one 
curriculum, the confusion among elementary school students who must learn three 
languages -- Chinese, their native language and English -- at the same time. 
Other issues that should be reviewed are the function and role of the basic 
competence test for junior-high school students, permanent classes and division 
into groups according to ability. The government should also pay attention to 
the educational quality following the influx of high schools and universities in 
recent years, teacher training, the allocation and effective use of central and 
local educational budgets,<br>
and the qualifications and expertise of education heads.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, a permanent education development committee should be 
established. The Cabinet's ad hoc Educational Reform Evaluation Committee was 
set up in 1994 as a temporary unit. It was dissolved two years later and policy 
planning was also discontinued. The Cabinet should review the difference in 
policies of the authorities in charge of planning and implementing educational 
reform over the past decade. It should also learn from Japan's educational 
evaluation committee and push legislation to establish a permanent education 
development committee to plan for, initiate and evaluate future reforms. 
Committee members should be experienced educators whose educational ideals 
transcend politics. They should include execution, management and evaluation in 
their policy-making and provide follow-up adjustments to guarantee that the 
educational vision and goals are reached.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, establish a mechanism for monitoring the improvement 
of education quality. Current methods of evaluating schools should be improved. 
For example, in the past everyone was held to the same standard. This should be 
changed and officials should try to<br>
understand how effectively a school improves student results from enrollment 
until graduation, instead of only looking at the ratio of graduates going on to 
study at prestigious educational institutions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support for student learning should be strengthened, for 
example, by dividing students into groups according to their field of study – 
and provide more resources to economically disadvantaged students, as well as 
tutoring according to student needs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More attention should be paid to on student character and 
labor education and more opportunities for learning outside the classroom should 
be provided. Parents and teachers should start campaigns to promote community 
concern and encourage students to attend<br>
service-oriented groups in schools or communities.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, sustainable development should be emphasized and existing 
educational advantages promoted. At a time when Taiwan is striving to promote 
economic development, we should also give future generations a chance for 
sustainable development.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Politicians, teachers and parents should be conscious of the impact 
of their actions on the next generation. They should also review the 
appropriateness of the current electoral system and try to restore past 
mainstream values -- diligence, humility, honesty, hospitality<br>
and thrift. They should also strive to improve awareness, apply proper 
restrictions on media and political parties and pay attention to the sustainable 
development of the natural and social environment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We should promote the advantages in Taiwan's society, such as 
parents' emphasis on education for their children, traditional respect for 
teachers, a well-developed Internet, the flexibility in people's thinking and 
the potential of becoming a model for combining traditional Chinese and modern 
Western culture. Our education system should integrate geographic features, such 
as Taiwan's 1,240km coastline and proximity to China, and make greater use of 
our natural resources and outstanding farming and fishery industries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we should emphasize the reconstruction and 
innovation of educational values, and give full play to the characteristics of 
East Asian education, turning competition for admission to higher education into 
a positive aspect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we should also stress Taiwan's advantages and 
culture to improve interest in studying and diversity, and thus build Taiwanese 
education.</font></span></p>
