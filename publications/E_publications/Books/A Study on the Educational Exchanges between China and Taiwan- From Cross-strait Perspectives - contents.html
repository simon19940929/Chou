<h1 class="ctr"  >A Study on the  Educational Exchanges between China and Taiwan: From Cross-strait  Perspectives </h1>
<h2 class="ctr">Chuing P. Chou&nbsp;&amp; Ching-yao Yang</h2>
<p>In recent years, issue such as &quot;globalization&quot; and  &quot;localization&quot; in higher education has attracted great attention. However,  with the economic rise of China and the reducing tension cross Taiwan Strait,  the application of globalization and localization in the interpretation of the competing  higher education relationship for both sides of Taiwan Strait can no longer  hold true. It is especially the case when China and Taiwan both currently are  encountering with the challenging issue of brain drain and mobility of talents in  the era of the transnational movement of higher education. As a result, it is  of great importance to re-examine cultural and educational exchanges between  the two sides with the possible development of a new theory entitled &ldquo;cross-straitization.&rdquo;  The paper attempts to explore the cross-strait exchanges in higher education over  the past 20 years, with an emphasis on the constant higher educational  interaction and cooperation over the last decade. It is hoped that the findings  will serve as the basis in constructing a new paradigm entitled &ldquo;cross-straitization&rdquo;  with the hope of shedding light on literature as well as serving as theoretical  reference model from cross-strait in alleviating conflicts between two parties,  namely North and South Korea, and so forth.</p>
