<span style="font-size: 14pt"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of 
Taiwan recently released the results of an evaluation of nine public 
universities conducted in the first half of last year. Although more than 89 
percent did not pass the evaluation, 42 faculties and graduate institutes were 
placed on a list for future monitoring.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, many of these were from universities with good 
reputations such as National Chengchi University and National Tsing Hua 
University. The Ministry of Education (MOE) has said that faculties and graduate 
institutes that did not pass the evaluation failed mostly because they suffered 
from a severe shortage of full-time teachers or failed to clearly define their 
teaching goals, adding that they would be closed if they failed to pass the next 
round of evaluations to be conducted next year.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taiwan¡¦s university evaluations had always been performed by 
external organizations. It was only in July 2006 that the council started 
conducting such evaluations, which were primarily aimed at faculties and 
graduate institutes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the most recent evaluations, faculties and graduate 
institutes first carried out self-evaluations and then mapped out development 
goals on their own. The evaluation center then visited and conducted interviews 
based on these development goals.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evaluations were based on five criteria: goals, 
specialties and self-improvement; curriculum; teaching; student performance; 
teacher research and graduate student performance. University evaluations can be 
positive if they can help faculties, graduate institutes, teachers and students 
redefine their goals for study and teaching.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the past two years, these evaluations have also 
given many schools a great deal of pressure.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This pressure includes having tens of thousands of university 
staff working around the clock to complete these evaluations, printing 
information onto tens of thousands of tonnes of paper, compiling statistical 
data and creating computer records, as well as demanding that faculty answer 
questions that are not suited to data-based research and requiring that teachers 
answer questions on classified research and other personal questions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially worthy of attention are those schools that may 
lose their social prestige because they fared poorly in their evaluations. These 
schools may even have their government subsidies decreased or canceled, and 
their admission quotas frozen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what we really must ask ourselves is whether the 
evaluated universities can really improve after all that energy, manpower and 
money was put into these assessments.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who benefits from this evaluation mechanism?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as one evaluation leader who had just finished a 
university evaluation said: ¡§When universities work day and night preparing 
information for never-ending evaluations and when teachers focus a great deal of 
energy on getting good results in National Science Council projects to help them 
obtain better evaluation results for their faculties, submitting articles to 
Social Science Citation Index journals, spending money to invite businesses to 
engage in industry-academic cooperation and even going overseas, including to 
China, to obtain doctoral degrees, teachers do not have a lot of time left to 
devote to their students.¡¨<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also do not have a lot of energy or concentration to 
devote to critical thinking and research. Indeed, there are now very few faculty 
directors and university presidents who can stop their schools from becoming 
more stratified and market-oriented, with an increasing emphasis on quantitative 
research.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the sharp increase in the number of university 
evaluations in recent years is closely linked to increasingly lower numbers of 
students being accepted into courses and a lack of places in courses, Taiwan¡¦s 
academic circle is very small, with more emphasis placed on interpersonal 
relationships over academic achievement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why there has been a move toward quantitative 
evaluations. In order to gain more prestige for Taiwan¡¦s universities on an 
international scale, many faculties in various universities have recently been 
focusing on working according to quantitative standards like those used in the 
Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the 
Engineering Index (EI) to make distinctions between their teachers in terms of 
seniority and skill.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the previous emphasis on self-determination of 
academic goals and a respect for the decisions of academics will cease to exist 
very soon. No wonder foreign academics have said that young academics here in 
Taiwan lock themselves up in research rooms and laboratories to write papers for 
SSCI and SCI journals and therefore have no time or interest in anything that 
goes on in society.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do universities really need evaluations? Almost everybody 
would agree that some sort of university evaluation is necessary. However, 
Taiwan¡¦s academic circle often ignores the differences between specialized 
academic fields, using physics and engineering standards to assess the 
humanities and social sciences, which has led to an over-emphasis on 
quantitative assessment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even government agencies and the evaluation center ignore the 
serious negative consequences of these quantitative evaluations ¡X Taiwan¡¦s 
entire academic field has become a center for academic contract manufacturing 
and reproduction. Universities are becoming more and more utilitarian and 
academic ideals and the passion teachers have for teaching are rapidly 
decreasing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we really hope that this current system of university 
evaluation will improve universities? In addition to their research, can we 
encourage teachers to place more emphasis on student progress? Perhaps we could 
get those faculties and graduate institutes that have already been assessed to 
provide us with their thoughts and even conduct a meta-analysis of the current 
evaluation system. This could turn the evaluations into a catalyst for a more 
open mindset and help universities find their ideals once again.<br>
